    <title>Order Of Operations</title>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Evaluate this expression, noting the order of operations.
          <me>
            \sqrt{\frac{(2)(73) + 254}{4}} - \sqrt{9} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <me>
            \sqrt{\frac{(2)(73) + 254}{4}} - \sqrt{9} 
          </me>
          The second square root just has a number in
          it, so it can be evaluted. The first square root has
          several operations inside it, so those operations must
          be done before the square root. We'll start with the
          multiplication in the numerator.
          <me>
            = \sqrt{\frac{146 + 254}{4}} - 3
          </me>
          There is a division (or fraction) inside the
          square root. However, the numerator of the fraction has
          a sum in it; we must do this sum before we can complete
          the fraction, as it is an inside piece of the fraction.
          <me>
            = \sqrt{\frac{400}{4}} - 3
          </me>
          How we can do the division.
          <me>
            = \sqrt{100} - 3
          </me>
          Now all the pieces inside the square root have been finished
          and we can evaluate the square root.
          <me>
            = 10 - 3 = 7
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Evaluate this expression, noting the order of operations.
          <me>
            3 - \frac{(6)(10)}{12} + (5-3)^2
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <me>
            3 - \frac{(6)(10)}{12} + (5-3)^2
          </me>
          We'll evalute the term in brackets first.
          <me>
            = 3 - \frac{(6)(10)}{12} + 2^2
          </me>
          Next we'll evaluate the exponent.
          <me>
            = 3 - \frac{(6)(10)}{12} + 4
          </me>
          Then we can do the multiplication and divisiosn in any
          order. I'll do the multiplication first.
          <me>
            = 3 - \frac{60}{12} + 4
          </me>
          Then I'll do the division.
          <me>
            = 3 - 5 + 4
          </me>
          Finally, we do the addition and subtraction.
          <me>
            3 - 5 + 4 =  -2 + 4 = 2
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>

    <title>Solving</title>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve for the variable <m>c</m>.
          <me>
            4c + 3(2-5c) + 9 = 0
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <me>
            4c + 3(2-5c) + 9 = 0
          </me>
          First we'll distribute the 3.
          <me>
            4c + 6 - 10c + 9 = 0
          </me>
          Then we can add the constants and the variable terms.
          <me>
            4c + 6 - 10c + 9 = 0
          </me>
          Then we can add the constants and the variable terms.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve for the variable <m>z</m>.
          <me>
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <me>
            4z - 8z + 5z = 9z
          </me>
          All the terms are mutliples of the variable.
          Let's get them all on one side of the equation. We can
          do this by subtracting <m>9z</m> from both sides of the
          equation.
          <me>
            4z - 8z + 5z -9z = 0 
          </me>
          Then we can add/subtract all the termx on the right.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              - 4z + 5z -9z \amp = 0 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              z  -9z \amp = 0 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              -8z  \amp = 0 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Finally, we can divide by <m>-8</m>
          <me>
            z = \frac{0}{-8} = 0 
          </me>
          <m>z=0</m> is the only solution. 
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve for the variable <m>r</m>.
          <me>
            \sqrt{5r + 9} = 7 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <me>
            \sqrt{5r + 9} = 7 
          </me>
          We need to get the variable out of the square
          root. We can do this by squaring both sides of the
          equation. (Again, we always perform the same operation
          to both sides to preserve the inequality.)
          <md>
            <mrow>
              (\sqrt{5r + 9})^2 = (7)^2 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              5r + 9 = 49 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then we can subtract 9 from both sides of the
          equation.}
          <me>
            5r = 40 
          </me>
          Finally, we divide both sides of the equation
          by 5.
          <me>
            r = 8
          </me>
        </p>
