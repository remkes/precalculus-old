      This section relies a bit on the concepts reviewed a future
      chapter on function, where we discuss the idea of a function.

    <p>
      If we have a function <m>y = f(x)</m> where <m>x</m> is the
      independent variables and <m>y</m> is the dependent variables,
      we can visualize the function using coordinates. The choice of
      <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> here intentionally matches with the
      choices of the axis of the plane. Our convention is to put the
      independent variable on the horizontal axis and the dependent
      variable on the vertical axis. Let's use an example function to
      show how we display the function with coordinates. I'll choose
      the square root function.
      <me>
        f(x) = \sqrt{x} 
      </me>
      Given any <m>x</m> value, say <m>x = 9</m>, the function outputs
      a <m>y</m> value which is the square root of the input, in this
      case <m>y = \sqrt{9} = 3</m>. That gives us a points in
      coorinates: <m>(9,3)</m>. All values of the function are pairs
      like this: an input and an ouput. All of these pairs can be
      thought of as coordinates. These coordinate produce a shape in
      the plane, which we call the <em>graph</em> of the function.
      <xref ref="figure-square-root-graph" /> shows the graph of the
      square root function with several points labeled.

            xlimits(-1,17);
            ylimits(-1,5);

            xaxis("$x$",Ticks("%"));
            yaxis("$y$",Ticks("%"));

            real f5(real x) {return sqrt(x);}
            draw(graph(f5,0,17));

            dot((1,1));
            dot((4,2));
            dot((9,3));
            dot((16,4));

            label("$(1,1)$",(1,1),SE);
            label("$(4,2)$",(4,2),NW);
            label("$(9,3)$",(9,3),NW);
            label("$(16,4)$",(16,4),NW);

      In this way, we can draw a picture of any function using
      coordinates. These pictures give us a very useful way to see
      what the function is doing. A lot of the qualitative analyais of
      functions is done throught their graphs. For the square root
      function, we can talk about how the function starts at the
      origin, increases steeply at first, but over time bends down and
      becomes a nearly horizontal.

      Computers (including calculations) are very good at graphing
      function. When I encounted a new function that I would like to
      understand, I'll usually ask a computer for a graph of the
      function, to give me an idea of what I'm working with. I
      encourage you to make use of this advantage of technology.
