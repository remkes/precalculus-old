      <statement>
        <p>
          Add these fractions.
          <me>
            \frac{5}{12} + \frac{3}{9} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can both the numerator and denominator of each fraction
          by the denominator of the other fraction to make a common
          denominator.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \frac{5}{12} + \frac{3}{9} \amp = \frac{5 \times 9}{12
              \times 9} + \frac{3 \times 12}{9 \times 12} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \frac{45}{108} + \frac{36}{108}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then we can add the numerators.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \frac{45 + 36}{108} = \frac{81}{108}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          We can reduce this fraction by dividing numberator and
          denominator by 27.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \frac{3}{4}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          We could also have noticed that <m>9</m> and <m>12</m> have
          a common factor of <m>3</m>, meaning that there is a smaller
          common denominator of <m>36</m>. Here is the calculation
          using that common denomninator instead.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \frac{5}{12} + \frac{3}{9} \amp = \frac{5 \times 3}{12
              \times 3} + \frac{3 \times 4}{9 \times 4} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \frac{15}{36} + \frac{12}{36}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \frac{15 + 12}{3r} = \frac{27}{36}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          We can reduce this fraction by dividing numberator and
          denominator by 9.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \frac{3}{4}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          After reducing to lowest terms, we see that this is the same
          result.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Subtract these fractions.
          <me>
            \frac{8}{5} - \frac{4}{7} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There are no common factors between <m>5</m> and <m>7</m>,
          so the smallest reasonable common denominator is their
          product, <m>35</m>. We multiply the numerator and
          denmoinator of the first fraction by <m>7</m> and likewise
          for the second fraction by <m>5</m>. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \frac{8}{5} - \frac{4}{7} \amp = 
              \frac{8 \times 7}{5 \times 7} - \frac{4 \times 5}{7
              \times 5}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \frac{56}{35} - \frac{20}{35}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \frac{56- 20}{35} = \frac{36}{35}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          This result is already in lowest terms, so we are finished.

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Multiply these fractions.
          <me>
            \left( \frac{3}{11} \right) \left( \frac{-4}{7} \right) 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To multiply fractions, we simply mulitply numerators and
          mulitply denominators.
          <me>
            \left( \frac{3}{11} \right) \left( \frac{-4}{7} \right) =
            \frac{3 \times (-4)}{11 \times 7} = \frac{-12}{77}
          </me>
          This is already in lowest terms. The negative can be written
          out front, since multiplying either numerator or denominator
          by <m>(-1)</m> is the same as making the whole fraction
          negative. 
          <me>
            = - \frac{12}{77} 
          </me>
        </p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Divide these fractions.
          <me>
            \frac{\frac{3}{5}}{\frac{10}{3}}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To divide fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal.
          <me>
            \frac{\frac{3}{5}}{\frac{10}{3}} = \frac{3}{5}
            \frac{3}{10} 
          </me>
          Then we just multiply numerator and denominator seperately. 
          <me>
            \frac{3}{5} \frac{3}{10} = \frac{3 \times 3}{5 \times 10}
            = \frac{9}{50} 
          </me>
          This is in lowest terms, so we are finished.

          As a decimal (calculate by long division or by

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Percentages are fractions of <m>100</m>, so we start with
          this percentage over <m>100</m>
          <me>
            \frac{48}{100}
          </me>
          Then we try to reduce. <m>4</m> is a common factor, so we
          divide numerator and denominator by <m>4</m>

          <me>
            \frac{1784 - 1403}{1403} \times 100 = \frac{381}{1403}

        <p>
          Percentage change is calculate following the description in
          <xref ref="subsection-fractions-percentages" />. Note that
          the second value is first in the numerator, which will lead
          to a negative value, which is expected for this decrease.
          <me>
            \frac{12512 - 17809}{17809} \times 100 = \frac{-5297}{17809}
