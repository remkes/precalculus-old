    <title>Functions as Models</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="subsection-what=is-a-function" />, I talked about
      three ways to understand a function. The third of these viewed
      functions as relationships or dependencies. This viewpoint is
      the most useful for applied mathematics: for using mathematics
      to understand some phenomenon in the real world. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If I use a function to describe some real world situation, that
      function is called a <term>model</term> of the situation.
      Applied mathematics is full of mathematical models. Let me start
      with a number of examples. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Movement in a straight line can be modeled by a function. the
        movement depends on time, so I will choose <m>t</m> for the
        independent variable. The function will measure distance, so I
        will write it <m>d(t)</m>.
