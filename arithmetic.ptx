    <title>Basic Operations</title>
    <p>
      I assume that you are comfortable with the basic arithmetic
      operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and
      division of numbers. The notations for addition and subtraction
      are consistent across mathematics. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The notations for multiplication and division, however, tend to
      change with context. In early context, multiplication is, of
      course, written with a times sign.
      <me>
        3 \times 7 = 21 
      </me>
      As our mathematical context grows, however, multiplication is
      more often written with adjacent symbols. For numbers, which
      requires parantheses.
      <me>
        (3)(7) = 21 
      </me>
      For variable, writing adjacent variables implies multiplication.
      <me>
        ab = a \times b 
      </me>
      Division has the same evolution. In first presentation, division
      is usually written with a division sign.
      <me>
        12 \div 4 = 3 
      </me>
      Again as out mathematical context grows, division is often
      written in fractional notation.
      <me>
        \frac{12}{4} = 3 
      </me>
      These is an important subtlety here: the notation <m>
      \frac{12}{4}</m> means two things at the same time: it is a
      fraction that we can work with and analyse as a fraction (with
      detail in <xref ref="chapter-fractions1" />, but it is also the
      division <m>12 \div 4</m>. When working with this symbol and
      similar symbols, people switch between these meanings
      automatically, usually without noticing or announcing the
      change. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the four basic arithmetic operations, we also
      have exponents to indicate iterated multiplication.
      <me>
        2^6 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 =
        (2)(2)(2)(2)(2)(2) = 32 
      </me>
      A future chapter will work on the properties and rules of
      exponents.

    <title>Distributive Law</title>
    <p>
      Addition and subtraction work well with each other (we can do
      them in any order). Multiplication and division likewise work
      well with each other. But we need a rule to describe the
      interaction between addition/subtraction and
      multiplication/division. This rule is likely familiar to you in
      practice, but the terminology might be new (depending on your
      mathematical background.) We call this the distributive law;
      more over, we say that multiplication/division distribute over
      addition/subtraction. This means that the multiplication or
      division will spread out and apply to each term in the addition
      or the subtraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some examples of the distributve law, using the variety
      of notations as discussed in the previous section. First,
      multiplication distributes over addition.
      <me>
        (4)(6 + 11) = (4)(6) + (4)(11) = 24 + 44 = 68
      </me>
      Second, multiplication distributes over subtraction.
      <me>
        7 \times (12 - 3) = 7 \times 12 - 7 \times 3 = 84 - 21 = 63
      </me>
      Third, division distributes over addition.
      <me>
        (6 + 4) \div 2 = 6 \div 2 + 4 \div 2 = 3 + 2 + 5 
      </me>
      Finally, division distributes over subtraction.
      <me>
        \frac{1}{7} (21 - 14) = \frac{21}{7} - \frac{14}{7} = 3 - 2 =
        1
      </me>
      There is a particular case of the distributive law for division
      when terms are written as fractions. Consider these two
      examples.
      <me>
        \frac{9 + 18}{3} = \frac{9}{3} + \frac{18}{3} = 3 + 6 = 9
      </me>
      <me>
        \frac{25 - 10}{5} = \frac{25}{5} - \frac{10}{5} = 5 - 2 = 3
      </me>
      This is the distributive law for divisions; the fraction is
      division and we apply the division to both term in the
      numerator. Very likely you may have learned this rule by a
      different name or explanation: something like splitting up the
      numerators of fractions. In particular, this only applies to
      numerators. We cannot split up denonminators of fractions. The
      following statement is <emph>NOT</emph> true.
      <me>
        \frac{1}{2 + 3} \neq \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} 
      </me>
      The right side is <m>\frac{1}{5}</m>. The left side (using
      common denominator as described in <xref
      ref="chapter-fractions1" />) is <m>\frac{5}{6}</m>. These are
      obviously not the same number.

    <title>Order of Operations</title>
    <!--

    <p>
      With multiple operations, we have conventions about how to write
      mathematical expressions so that the operations are clear. Most
      importantly, we have an order or precedence for operations. 
      <ol>
        <li>  
          We use parentheses to group pieces of a mathematical
          expression. Parantheses take precedence over all 
          operations, so they can always be use to be explicit and
          clear about how we want our expression to be understood. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes one operations is <emph>inside</emph> another
          operation. For example, here is addition inside a square
          root.
          <me>
            \sqrt{9 + 15}
          </me>
          Similarly, here is an exponent and a subtraction inside a
          fraction (hence inside a division operation).
          <me>
            \frac{50}{2^3+3}
          </me>
          Any of these inside pieces have to happen before the outside
          operation can happen. This is sort of like parenthesis, and
          we could rewrite these with parentheses to make them more
          transparent. 
          <me>
            \sqrt{(9 + 15)}
          </me>
          <me>
            \frac{50}{(2^3+3)}
          </me>
          Even without the explicit parentheses, these inside pieces
          take precedence as if they had parentheses.
        </li>
        <!--
        <li>
          Exponents take precedence over the four basic arithmetic
          operations. Square roots (and other roots) are essentially
          exponents (as discussed in <xref ref="chapter-exponents1"
          />, so they happen in this step as well. 
        </li>
        -->
        <li>
          Exponents take precedence over the four basic arithmetic
          operations. Square roots (and other roots) are essentially
          exponents (this will be discussed in a future chapter),
          so they happen in this step as well. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Multiplication and division take precedence over addition
          and subtraction. We can treat multiplication and division as
          one step since we can interchange the order of
          multiplication and division without problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, addition and subtraction have the lowest
          precedence. Again, we can treat these two in one step
          because we can interchange the order of additions and
          subtractions without problem. 
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <example>
      <me>
        (5-2)^2 + \frac{21}{7}
      </me>
      The parentheses take first precedence, so we do the subtraction
      in the paranethesis. 
      <me>
        (3)^2 + \frac{21}{7}
      </me>
      Exponents are next. 
      <me>
        9 + \frac{21}{7}
      </me>
      Division is next. 
      <me>
        9 + 3 
      </me>
      Addition is last.
      <me>
        12
      </me>
    </example>
    <example>
      <me>
        \frac{(10)(6)(4)}{(2)(5)}
      </me>
      This is all multiplication and division, so we can do the
      operations in any order we wish. To demonstrate that the order
      doesn't matter, I'll do this in a variety of order. First, I'll
      multiply the numerator. 
      <me>
        \frac{(60)(4)}{(2)(5)} = \frac{240}{(2)(5)}
      </me>
      Then I'll multiply the denominator. 
      <me>
        \frac{240}{(2)(5)} = \frac{240}{10} 
      </me>
      Then I'll finish with the division.
      <me>
        \frac{240}{10} = 24
      </me>
      Alternatively, I could have started with 10 divided by 2, which
      is 5. 
      <me>
        \frac{(10)(6)(4)}{(2)(5)} = \frac{(5)(6)(4)}{(5)}
      </me>
      Then I could do 5 divided by 5, which is 1. 
      <me>
        \frac{(5)(6)(4)}{(5)} = (1)(6)(4) 
      </me>
      Finally, multiplying by 1 doesn't do anything and <m>6 \times 4
      = 24</m>, so I recover the same answer. There are many more
      possible orders for all these multiplications and divisions, but
      all of them will still result in an answer of 24. 
    </example>
    <example>
      <me>
        \frac{\sqrt{5^2 + 11}}{(4)(5) - 14} 
      </me>
      We have two inside pieces: something inside a square root and
      something inside a fraction (in the denominator). Therefore, we
      have to do these two pieces before evaluating the square root or
      the division. First we do the square root. Inside the square
      root, we have an exponent and addition; we do the exponent
      first. 
      <me>
        \frac{\sqrt{25 + 11}}{(4)(5) - 14} 
      </me>
      Then we do the addition. 
      <me>
        \frac{\sqrt{36}}{(4)(5) - 14} 
      </me>
      The inside of the square root is finished, so we can now do the
      square root (which has the precedence of an exponent, so it
      happens before the division). 
      <me>
        \frac{6}{(4)(5) - 14} 
      </me>
      Now we look to the inside of the division; we can't do the
      division before the operations in the denominator. The
      denominator has multiplication and subtraction; we do the
      multiplication first. 
      <me>
        \frac{6}{20 - 14} 
      </me>
      Then we do the subtraction.
      <me>
        \frac{6}{6} 
      </me>
      Finally, since the inside pieces are finished, we can do the
      division. 
      <me>
        \frac{6}{6} = 1
      </me>
    </example>
