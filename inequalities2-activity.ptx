    <title>Solving with Absolute Value</title>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve this equation.
          <me>
            |h - 5| + 4 = 12
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First I want to isolate the absolute value, so I'll
          subtract <m>4</m> from both sides. 
          <me>
            |h - 5| = 8
          </me>
          The first case is for <m>h \geq 5</m>, when the term in the
          absolute value is positive. 
          <me>
            h - 5 = 8
          </me>
          In this case, we solve and get <m>h = 13</m>, which is a
          valid solution in the range for this case. The second case
          is <m>h \lt 5</m>, where the term in the absolute value is
          negative. 
          <me>
            (-1)(h - 5) = 8
          </me>
          Then we proceed to solve by multiplying by <m>(-1)</m> and
          adding <m>5</m> to get <m>h = -3</m>. This solution is in
          the approprate range for this case. We conclude that there
          are two solutions: <m>h = 13</m> and <m>h = -3</m>. We can
          also observe that these are exactly the two number which are
          distance <m>8</m> away from 5, which is a reasonable
          interpretation of the original equation. 
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve this equation.
          <me>
            -8|r + 8| + 2 = 0 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First I want to isolate the absolute value, so I'll
          subtract <m>2</m> from both sides. 
          <me>
            -8|r + 8| = -2
          </me>
          Then I'll divide both sidse by <m>-8</m>. 
          <me>
            |r + 8| = \frac{1}{4} 
          </me>
          Then we work in cases. The term in the absolute value is
          positive when <m>r \geq -8</m>, so that is our first case.
          In this case, we can just drop the absolute value. 
          <me>
            r + 8 = \frac{1}{4} 
          </me>
          Then we can solve, finding that <m>r = \frac{-31}{4}</m>.
          This is greater (slightly) than <m>-8</m>, so it is a valid
          solution for the first case. We move on to the second
          case, where the term in the absolute value is negative. This
          happens when <m>r \lt -8</m>. We multiply the absolute value
          term by <m>(-1)</m>.
          <me>
            (-1)(r + 8) = \frac{1}{4} 
          </me>
          Then we solve. We multiply both sides by <m>(-1)</m> and
          then subtract <m>8</m> from both sides to sinde <m>r =
          \frac{-33}{4}</m>. This is less (slightly) than <m>-8</m>,
          so it is a valid solution for the second case. In total, we
          have two solution, <m>r = \frac{-31}{8}</m> and <m>r =
          \frac{-33}{8}</m>. 
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve this equation.
          <me>
            |w + 5| + 12 = 4|w + 5|
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Here there are two terms which involve <m>|w + 5|</m>. I
          would like to only have one such term. To get there, I can
          subtract <m>|w + 5|</m> from both sides of the equation. On
          the right side, we have <m>4</m> of this term; subtracting
          one of them leaves, of course, <m>3</m> of the term.
          <me>
            12 = 3|w + 5|
          </me>
          Then I can divide both sides of the equation by <m>3</m>.
          <me>
            4 = |w + 5|
          </me>
          Now I can work with the two cases that apply to an absolute
          value. In the first case, <m>w \geq -5</m> and I can just
          drop the absolute value. 
          <me>
            4 = w + 5
          </me>
          We solve this to get <m>w = -1</m>, which is a valid
          solution in our case. In the second case, <m>w \lt -5</m>
          and I multiply by <m>(-1)</m> for the absolute value. 
          <me>
            4 = (-1)(w + 5)
          </me>
          I can solve this (multiply by <m>(-1)</m> and subtract 5) to
          get <m>w = -9</m>. This is a value solution in the range for
          the second case. In total, we conclude that we have two
          solutions: <m>w = -1</m> and <m>w = -9</m>. 
        </p>

    <title>Inequalities with Absolute Value</title>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve this inequality. 
          <me>
            |u - 3| \geq 7
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I can split this into two inequalities. For the negative
          case, I have to reverse the inequality. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u - 3 \amp \geq 7 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              u - 3 \amp \leq -7 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then we can solve these inequalities by adding 3 to both
          sides.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u \amp \geq 10 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              u \amp \leq -4 
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve this inequality. 
          <me>
            5|b + 10| \lt 15b
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First I'll divide each side by <m>5</m>.
          <me>
            |b + 10| \lt 3b
          </me>
          Then we can work in the two cases required for absolute
          value. For the first case, <m>b \geq -10</m> and we can drop
          the absolute value.
          <me>
            b + 10 \lt 3b
          </me>
          We can subtract <m>b</m> from both sides. 
          <me>
            10 \lt 2b
          </me>
          Then I can divide by <m>2</m>.
          <me>
            5 \lt b
          </me>
          We get the range <m>b \gt 5</m>, which is included in this
          case, so we can accept the entire range as part of the
          solution. Now we move on to the second case, where <m>b \lt
          -10</m>. In this case, we multiply the absolute value term
          by <m>(-1)</m>. 
          <me>
            (-1)(b + 10) \lt 3b
          </me>
          Then we solve. We start by multiplying by <m>(-1)</m>, which
          reverses the inequality.
          <me>
            b + 10 \gt -3b
          </me>
          Then we can subtract <m>b</m> from both sides. 
          <me>
            10 \gt -4b
          </me>
          Finally, we can divide by <m>-4</m>, which again reverses
          the inequality.
          <me>
            - \frac{5}{2} \lt b
          </me>
          We get a range of <m>b \gt -\frac{5}{2}</m>. However, this
          case is only consider <m>b \lt -10</m>. There is no overlap
          between these ranges, so there are no solution in this case.
          We conclude that the original inequality is solved simply by
          the range <m>b \gt 5</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve this inequality. 
          <me>
            |k^2 + 9| \gt 14
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We work in our two cases. In the first case, we want the
          term in the absolute value to be positive: <m>k^2 + 9 \gt
          0</m> or <m>k^2 \gt -9</m>. But square are always positive,
          so this inequality is always satisfied. In this situation,
          the first case covers all number and there is not second
          case. Since the term in the absolute value is positive, we
          can just drop the absolute value and solve.
          <me>
            k^2 + 9 \gt 14
          </me> 
          We subtract <m>9</m> from both sides.
          <me>
            k^2 \gt 5
          </me> 
          Here I follow <xref
          ref="subsection-inequalities-squareroots" /> to solve this
          inequality. One piece of the solution is the direct square
          root of the inequality: <m>k \gt \sqrt{5}</m>. But I also
          have to consider negative <m>k</m> which become positive
          when squares. This gives me the second part of the solution:
          <m>k \lt -\sqrt{5}</m>. The solution to the original
          inequality consists of both these ranges.
