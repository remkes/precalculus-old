          Add these fractions. Simplify the result if reasonable to do
          so. 
          <me>
            \frac{h^2}{h+3} + \frac{h-6}{4h}

        <p>
          There are no common factors here, so the common denominator
          is simply the produce of the two denominators. We multiply
          the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by
          <m>4h</m> and the second fraction by <m>(h+3)</m>. (We need
          to avoid <m>h = 0</m> and <m>h = -3</m> to avoid division by
          zero). 
          <me>
            \frac{h^2(4h)}{(h+3)(4h)} + \frac{(h-6)(h+3)}{4h(h+3)}
          </me>
          Then we can put this into one fraction with the common
          denominator and expand the multiplications in the numerator
          to see how they can be combined.
          <me>
            = \frac{4h^3 + h^2 - 3h - 18}{4h(h+3)} 
          </me>
          Note that the values <m>h = 0</m> and <m>h = -3</m> are
          invalid value for this calculation.

          Subtract these fractions. Simplify the result if reasonable to do
          so. 
          <me>
            \frac{\cos x}{x^2} - \frac{\sin x}{x(x-3)}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There is a common factor in these denominators, so I'll look
          for a better choice than just the product of the two
          denominators. I need <m>x^2</m> for the first and a factor
          of <m>(x-3)</m> so the second, so the common denominator
          <m>x^2(x-3)</m> should work. I'll multiply the numerator and
          denominator of the first fraction by <m>(x-3)</m>, and by
          <m>x</m> for the second fraction.
          <me>
            = \frac{(\cos x)(x-3)}{(x^2)(x-3)} - \frac{(\sin
            x)(x)}{x(x-3)(x)}
          </me>
          I'll expand the various multiplications and write the result
          over the common demoninator.
          <me>
            = \frac{(x - 3)\cos x - x \sin x}{(x^2)(x - 3)}
          </me>
          I could write this numerator different, but it's not
          obviously simpler one way of another. I'll leave it like
          this. Note that <m>x = 0</m> and <m>x = 3</m> are invalid
          value for this calculation.

          <me>
            \frac{t^2}{\tan t} + \frac{1}{t^3} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There are no common factors here, so the common denominator
          is simply the produce of the two denominators. We multiply
          the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by
          <m>t^3</m> and the second fraction by <m>(\tan t)</m>. 
          <me>
            \frac{(t^2)(t^3)}{(tan t)(t^3)} + \frac{(\tan
            t)}{(t^3)(\tan t)} 
          </me>
          Then we can put this into one fraction with the common
          denominator and expand the multiplications in the numerator
          to see if they can be combined.
          <me>
            = \frac{t^5 + \tan t}{t^3 \tan t} 
          </me>
          There is nothing else to be done to simplify or combine this
          expression. Note that the value <m>t = 0</m> and all the
          possible (infintely many!) <m>t</m> such that <m>\tan t =
          0</m> are invalid for this calculation.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Subtract these fractions. Simplify the result if reasonable
          to do so. 
          <me>
            \frac{j - 5}{j - 7} - \frac{j^2 + 4}{(j - 7)^2}        
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Both fractions have powers of <m>(j - 7)</m> in the
          denominators. I should be able to use the highest power of
          <m>(j - 7)</m> as the common denominator. In this plan, I
          actually can leave the second fraction entirely untouched
          and multiply the numerator and denominator of the first
          fraction by <m>(j - 7)</m>.
          <me>
            \frac{(j - 5)(j - 7)}{j - 7(j - 7)} - \frac{j^2 + 4}{(j -
            7)^2}
          </me>
          Then I can expand the numerator in the first fraction and
          write the subtraction over the common denominator. I must be
          careful to apply the subtraction to both piece of the second
          numerator. 
          <me>
            = \frac{j^2 - 12j + 35 - (j^2 + 4)}{(j - 7)^2}
          </me>
          Then I can simplify the numerator by grouping like powers of
          <m>j</m>. The <m>j^2</m> terms will cancel. 
          <me>
            = \frac{- 12j + 31}{(j - 7)^2}
          </me>
          There is nothing more to do to simplify this expression.
          Note that <m>j = 7</m> is invalid for this calculation. 
        </p>
      </solution>

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Multiply these fractions. Simplify the result if reasonable
          to do so. 
          <me>
            \frac{z^2}{(z-2)^2} \frac{(z-1)(z-2)}{z^4} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First we can simply multiply the numerators and
          denominators. 
          <me>
            \frac{z^2}{(z-2)^2} \frac{(z-1)(z-2)}{z^4} =
            \frac{z^2(z-1)(z-2)}{z^4(z-2)^2} 
          </me>
          I notice that there are some common factor here. Since
          everything here is multiplication, everything is already a
          factor of the whole numerator or denominator, so I can
          proceed to cancel some terms. First, <m>z^2</m> is a factor
          of both numerator and denominator, so I can cancel that off. 
          <me>
            \frac{z^2(z-1)(z-2)}{z^4(z-2)^2} = 
            \frac{(z-1)(z-2)}{z^2(z-2)^2} 
          </me>
          Next, <m>(z-2)</m> is also a common factor, so I can cancel
          it off as well.
          <me>
            \frac{(z-1)(z-2)}{z^2(z-2)^2} = \frac{(z-1)}{z^2(z-2)} 
          </me>
          INow there are no common factors, so this is the final
          result. Throughout the calculation, I note that <m>z = 0</m>
          and <m>z = 2</m> are values that would lead to division by
          zero and therefore must be avoided. 
        </p>
      </solution>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Divide these fractions. Simplify the result if reasonable
          to do so. 
          <me>
            \frac{\frac{7x-14}{x^2}}{\frac{4x-8}{x^3}}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To divide fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal.
          <me>
            \left( \frac{7x-14}{x^2} \right) \left( \frac{x^3}{4x-8}
            \right) = \frac{(7x-14)(x^3)}{(x^2)(4x-8)}
          </me>
          Then we can try to simplify. There is a common factor of
          <m>x^2</m> in the numerator and denominator, so we can
          cancel that off. 
          <me>
            = \frac{(7x-14)(x)}{(4x-8)}
          </me>
          Looking more carefully, we can factor <m>7</m> out of the
          numerator and <m>4</m> out of the denominator.
          <me>
            = \frac{7(x-2)(x)}{4(x-2)}
          </me>
          This factoring reveals a common factor of <m>(x-2)</m> in
          the numerator and denominator. We can cancel this common
          factor off as well. 
          <me>
            = \frac{7x}{4}
          </me>
          No more simplification can be done here, since this is a
          pretty concise answer. Note that throughout this question,
          we have to avoid <m>x = 2</m> and <m>x = 0</m>.
