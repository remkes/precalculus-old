      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve this inequality. Express your answer in a simple
          inequality or in words. 
          <me>  
            -5t + 13 \lt 26
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can subtract <m>13</m> from both sides. This preserves in
          inequality.
          <me>  
            -5t \lt 13
          </me>
          We can divide by <m>-5</m> on both sides. This reverses the
          inequality
          <me>  
            t \lt \frac{13}{-5} = - \frac{13}{5} 
          </me>
          This solve the inequality, which descries all number less
          than <m>-\frac{13}{5}</m>. 
        </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve this inequality. Express your answer in a simple
          inequality or in words. 
          <me>  
            9p + 4 \gt 13p - 10
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can add 10 to both sides. This preserves the inequality.
          <me>  
            9p + 14 \gt 13p 
          </me>
          We can subtract <m>9p</m> from both sides. This preserves
          the inequality.
          <me>  
            14 \gt 4p 
          </me>
          We can divide by 4 on both sides. This preserves the
          inequality. 
          <me>  
            \frac{14}{4} \gt p 
          </me>
          This solves the inequality, which describes all number less
          than <m>\frac{14}{2}</m>. 
        </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve this inequality. Express your answer in a simple
          inequality or in words. 
          <me>  
            \sqrt{4t-5} \lt 100
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can square both sides. Since both sides are positive,
          this will preserve the inequality.
          <me>  
            4t-5 \lt 10000
          </me>
          Then we can add 5 to both sides. This preserves the
          inequality.
          <me>  
            4t \lt 10005
          </me>
          Then we can divide both sides by 4. This preserves the
          inequality.
          <me>  
            t \lt \frac{10005}{4}
          </me>
          This gives us a range of solutions: all numbers less than
          <m>\frac{10005}{4}</m>. However, we also have to make sure
          the square root is defined. This means we also have 
          <me>  
            4t - 5 \geq 0 
          </me>
          We can solve this similarly, by adding 5 then dividing by 4. 
          <me>  
            t \geq \frac{5}{4} 
          </me>
          This gives a lower bound for the variable <m>t</m>. All in
          all, we conclude that <m>t</m> must be greater than or equal to
          <m>\frac{5}{4}</m>, but less than <m>\frac{10005}{4}</m>. 
        </p>
      </solution>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve this inequality. Express your answer in a simple
          inequality or in words. 
          <me>  
            t^2 + 1 \geq 5
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can subtract <m>1</m> from both sides, which preserves
          the inequality. 
          <me>  
            t^2 \geq 4
          </me>
          Then we can square root both sides. Since both sides are
          positive, this preserves the inequality.
          <me>  
            t \geq 2
          </me>
          We also have to consider the possibility that <m>t</m> might
          have been negative. If so, its square would still be
          positive. In order for the square to exceed <m>4</m>, we
          need <m>t \leq -2</m>. Therefore, this inequality is solved
          by two groups of numbers: those greater than or equal to
          <m>2</m> and those less than or equal to <m>-2</m>.
        </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve this inequality. Express your answer in a simple
          inequality or in words. 
          <me>  
            y^2 + 4 \lt 2
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We subtract <m>4</m> from both sides of the equation. 
          <me>  
            y^2 \lt -2
          </me>
          We could try to keep going here, but there is a problem. The
          right side is positive (all squares are positive), but it is
          supposed to be less than a negative number. This cannot
          happen. We conclude that there are no number which satisfy
          this inequality.

            What is an inequality?

          <li>
            When we work with equality, we can perform any operation
            as long as we apply it to both sides. Why isn't that true
            for inequalities? Why do some operations preserve, some
            reverse, and some to not respect inequalities at all?
