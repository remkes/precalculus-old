      Welcome to this set of modules for prerequisite mathematics.
      There are many reasons why you may have found your ways to these
      notes: among other possibilities, you might be a high school
      student wanting some review or preparation before entering
      unviersity; you may be a prospective student who needs a math
      prerequisite for entry into one of our programs; you may be a
      current university student who likewise needs a high-school
      prerequisite mathematics credit; or you might be a student in a
      university math course who wants to review their background
      skills and concepts. Whatever the case, I hope you find these
      modules useful and helpful.

      These notes are designed to accompany a set of videos explaining
      the concepts and walking through various examples. The videos
      can be found <url

      this YouTube playlist</url>.

      These notes include activities in each section. Mathematics is
      learned by practice and activity. I suggest you try each
      activity on your own and then compare your attempt with the
      solutions. All the solutions are provided in these notes, to aid
      in self-study.

    <title>Skill and Concepts</title>
    <p>
      There is a temptation to treat mathematics as simply a set of
      skills or tools. Certainly, skills are important and the
      majority of these modules focus on specific skills. But skills
      without concepts are not mathematics. For success in courses
      that require mathematics, we need you to understand the
      mathematical concepts just as much (if not more) than we need
      you to have the mathematical skills. In these notes and the
      accompanying videos, I focus heavily on concepts. Likewise, each
      activity includes a set of conceptual questions. I encourage you
      to use these questions to test yourself. If the concepts are not
      clear, go back to the videos and the notes again and see if you
      can pick on the concepts presented.

    <title>Scope</title>
    <p>
      For many of you working through this material, your goal will be
      writing the assessment test for a Math 30-2 or Math 30-1
      prerequisite to allow you to register in a course or enrol in a
      program. These notes and the accompanying videos are designed to
      prepare you for those tests. However, this should not be treated
      as a full replacement for Math 30-2 or Math 30-1 (and nothing in
      this sytem is designed to allow you to apply to the province of
      Alberta for credit for those courses). Instead of trying to
      cover all of the content in those high-school courses, we've
      chosen particular concepts and skills which are actually used in
      our university courses. Practically and pragmatically, this is
      more focus on what you specifically need to succeed in
      university, as opposed to covering the whole swath of
      high-school level mathematics.

    <title>Level</title>
    <p>
      These notes and the accompanying videos are designed for
      multiple audiences with a wide variety of skill levels in
      mathematics. The level of this material ranges over many grade
      levels when compared to the Alberta school curriculum. Since
      these notes and the accompanying videos are designed mostly for
      self study, I encourage you to spend your time on whichever
      parts of the material that are challenging to you. For most of
      you, there will be pieces of this material that are well known;
      proceed quickly through those pieces to the concepts and skills
      where you need work and review.
