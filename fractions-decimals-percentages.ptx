      When we write a number, we often have choice of how to represent
      it. Consider all of these numbers:
      <me>
        4 \text{ or }
        4.0 \text{ or }
        4.\bar{0} \text{ or }
        \frac{4}{1} \text{ or }
        \sqrt{16} \text{ or }
        \frac{12}{3} 
      </me>
      These are all ways of writing the same number. One of the subtle
      and implicit skills in mathematics is switching between the
      different ways of writing numbers. We aren't going to get into
      all the detail of this switching in these notes, but I'll
      mentioned a few points in this section.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-fraction-decimals">
    <title>Fractions and Decimals</title>
    <p>
      Decimal expansion carry meaning using powers of <m>10</m>. The
      decimal
      <me>
        5.098
      </me>
      exactly means the fraction 
      <me>
        \frac{5098}{1000}
      </me>.
      From that point, we could reduce the fraction to lowest terms if
      we wish. <m>2</m> is a common factor, so we can divide by 2. 
      <me>
        \frac{5098}{1000} = \frac{2599}{500}
      </me>
      There are no more common factors, so this is lowest terms. 
      <me>
        5.098 = \frac{2599}{500}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, for a finite decimal expansions, we can write it as
      a fraction over a power of <m>10</m>. The power of <m>10</m> is
      determined by the number of digits after the decimal point: if
      there are <m>n</m> digits, then the denominator of the fraction
      is <m>10^n</m>. In the example above, there were three digits,
      so the denominator was <m>10^3 = 1000</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some numbers are expressed as infinite repeating decimals.
      <me>
        0.36363636\ldots
      </me>
      These are often written with a bar over the repeating piece to
      indicated repetition.
      <me>
        0.36363636\ldots = 0.\overline{36}
      </me>
      All repeating decimals can be expressed as fractions. There is a
      general algorithm for doing so, but I've decided not to put that
      algorithm in these notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, there is a general algorithm for writing a fraction as
      a repeated decimal, essentially doing long division until we
      produce a repeating string of digits. Again, I've decided not to
      put that algorithm in these notes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, some numbers can only be written as non-repeating
      decimals. Here is the start of the decimal expansion for
      <m>\sqrt{2}</m>.
      <me>
        \sqrt{2} \doteq 1.41421356237 \ldots
      </me>
      There is no regular pattern to these digits. Since there is no
      regular pattern, <m>\sqrt{2}</m> cannot be written as a
      fraction. It is an irrational number (by definition, a number
      which cannot be expressed as a fraction). All fractions
      correspond to repeating decimals expansions and any
      non-repeating decimal expansion corresponds to an irrational
      number. I'll talk more about the concepts of repeating and
      non-repeating decimals using the idea of rational and irrational
      numbers in <xref ref="section-number-line" />.

    <title>How Should I Write a Number?</title>
    <p>
      If we have all these different ways to write numbers, which ones
      should we choose? The answers, of course, is that it depends on
      the context and the need. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Though much could be said on this topic, the major point I want
      to make in this section is the difference between exact and
      approximate values. By exact values, I mean any symbol or
      expression that tells us exactly which number we are talking
      about. For example, <m>\pi</m> is an exact value, where
      <m>3.1415</m> is an approxmation. Similarly, <m>\sqrt{7}</m> is an
      exact value, where <m>2.65</m> is an approximation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When writing approximate values, it's not strictly correct to
      use the equals sign. An approximation is not equal to the
      original number -- it's just approximately equal. There are
      (unfortunately) several common notations for approximately
      equal. In these notes, I use an equals sign with a dot to
      indicate approximation.
      <me>
        \pi \doteq 3.1415
      </me>
      The other most common notation is an equals sign with a
      tidle-like symbol on top.
      <me>
        \pi \cong 3.1415
      </me>
      You should use one of these symbols whenever you write an
      approxmation, to indicate that you've moved frome exact values
      to approximate values. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Exact values are good for any kind of mathematical procedure.
      Usually when we are doing calculations, proofs or other
      mathematical constructions, we want to work with exact values.
      In pure mathematics, we work almost exclusively with exact
      values. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there are limitations. Perhaps we do a long calculation
      and end up with the following exact value.
      <me>
        \pi^2 + 7\sqrt{\frac{53}{2}} 
      </me>
      That's a fine exact value, but at a glance is it very hard to
      know, roughly, what size of number this is. That's where
      approximation is more valuable. 
      <me>
        \pi^2 + 7\sqrt{\frac{53}{2}} \doteq 45.904
      </me>
      Writing an approximate decimal value gives us a better sense of
      this number: it's nearly 46. It we needed to use this in some
      application, we'd probably want to know this approximate value. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So why don't we work with approximate values all the way
      through? Sometimes we do, but there is a problem. Approximate
      values have an error. If I write <m>\pi \doteq 3.14</m>, this
      has an error of a little less than <m>\frac{1}{500}</m>. For
      whatever you are doing, that might be a perfectly reasonable
      amount of error. However, error propogates through calculate. As
      you do arithmetic with approximate values, the error gets works.
      As an example, <m>3.14^2 = 9.8596</m> but a <m>\pi^2 \doteq
      9.8696</m>. The error is now a little more than
      <m>\frac{1}{100}</m>. If we continued to do more arithmetic, the
      error will grow. After a few of arithmetic steps, the error
      might be larger than the number itself, making the calculation
      meaningless. The study of error and error propogation is a
      branch of mathematics itself, which I'm not going to cover. My
      point here is that we use exact values when we can in order to
      limit the propogation or error. If we want an approximate
      decimal answer, it is best to do the approximates as late as
      possible in the calculation.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-fractions-percentages">
    <title>Fractions and Percentages</title>
    <p>
      A percentage is a fraction of <m>100</m> (literally, from the
      Latin <qt>per centum</qt>, meaning from a hundred). When we
      write <m>47\%</m>, we mean this fraction and decimal:
      <me>
        \frac{47}{100} = 0.47
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To convert from fractions to decimals, we multiply by <m>100</m>.
      The fraction <m>3/17</m> has a decimal approximation of
      <m>0.1764</m>. Multiplying by <m>100</m> gives <m>17.64\%</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To convert from decimals to fraction, we divide by <m>100</m>.
      <m>48\%</m> becomes the fraction <m>\frac{48}{100}</m>, which
      can be writen in lowest terms as <m>\frac{12}{25}</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many common operations with percentages in a variety
      of application. For these notes, I've chosen to simply include
      one: percentage changes. If we have two values, how do we
      calculate the percentage change from one value to the other? If
      the values are <m>a_1</m> and <m>a_2</m>, then the 
      percentage change from <m>a_1</m> to <m>a_2</m> is calculate by 
      <me>
        \frac{a_2 - a_1}{a_1} \times 100 
      </me>.
      For an example, say a population increases from <m>154,244</m>
      to <m>157,934</m>. I'll just apply the previous expression.
      <me>
        \frac{157934 - 154244}{154244} \times 100 \doteq 2.39
      </me>
      The percentage increase in this population is approximately
      <m>2.39\%</m>.
