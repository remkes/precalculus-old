      While most of these modules are focus on the skills and
      techniques of algebra and functions, this section is devoted to
      (two-dimensional) geometry. The type of geometry that you need
      to learn or review here is Cartesian geometry: geometry
      described by coordintaes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Coordinates are a way of identifying points in geometry (and,
      once we have points, also shapes, distances, and many other
      constructions). The setup of coordinates has several steps. The
      <ul>
        <li>
          We are working in a two dimensional environment. I'll call
          this environment simply <em>the plane</em>. If you want to be
          more specific, you could call is <em>the Cartesian plane</em>
          to indicate the coordinate system we are using. 
        </li>
        <li>
          First, we choose a point to act as the centre of the plane.
          This point is called the <em>origin</em>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Going out from the origin are two lines, one horizontal and
          one vertical. These are called <em>axes</em>. By convention,
          we usually called the horizontal axis the <m>x</m>-axis and
          the vertical axis the <m>y</m>-axis. The axis have a notion
          of distance along them, often indicated by marks like on a
          ruler. Again by convention, we think of moving right as
          the positive <m>x</m> direction and moving up as the
          positive <m>y</m> direction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once we have the origin and the axis, then any point in the
          plane can be identified by its position relative to the two
          axis. The point <m>(3,6)</m> is the unique point that we get
          to by moving <m>3</m> units horizontally (to the right) and
          moving <m>6</m> units vertically (upward). If we have negative
          coordinates, we move in the other direction. The point
          <m>(-5,-2)</m> is the unique point that we get to by moving
          <m>5</m> units horizontally (to the left, since it is negative)
          and <m>2</m> units vertically (downward, since it is
          negative). 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <xref ref="figure-points-in-the-cartesian-plane" /> shows five
      points and their coordinates. The point <m>(0,0)</m> is the
      origin.
