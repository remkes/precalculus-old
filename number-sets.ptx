    <title>Sets of  Numbers</title>
    <p>
      A simple but useful idea in mathematics is the idea of a
      <term>set</term>. A set is nothing but a collection of things.
      It can be any things, but for the purposes of these notes, I'll
      strick to sets of numbers. The things in a set are called the
      <term>elements</term> of the set. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A set can be described directly using braces and explicitly
      listing its elements. The set
      <me>
        A = \left\{ 4, 8, 22 \right} 
      </me>
      has three elements: the numbers <m>4</m>, <m>8</m> and
      <m>22</m>. Here <sq><m>A</m></sq> is the name of the set and the
      right side is the explicit description. (Following convention,
      I'll usually use capital letters as names for sets.) The
      notation to say that something is an element uses this strange
      symobl, something like a stylized letter <sq>e</sq>. 
      <me>
        4 \in A 
      </me>
      If I want to say that something is not a member of set, I can
      put a cross through this symbol. 
      <me>
        5 \notin A 
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      A set is just an unorganized collection: there is no structure.
      It's is entirely determined by its elements. There are a complet
      of important consequenes of this idea. First, order doesn't
      matter. The following two expressions define exactly the same
      set.
      <me>
        \left{ 6, -13, \frac{5}{7}, \pi \right\} = \left\{ \pi, -13, 6
        \frac{5}{7} \right\} 
      </me>
      Second, repetition of elements isn't part fo the definition of a
      set. All that matter is whether some number is or isn't in the
      set. The following sets are likewise exactly the same.
      <me>
        \left\{ 1, 1, 3, 3, 1 \right\} = \left\{1, 3\right\}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to explicit descriptions of sets by simply listing
      elements, there are many other wasy to describe sets. Mostly
      importantly, I can simply describe them with words. To describe
      the set 
      <me>
      {2,4,6,8,10,12}
      </me>
      I could say <sq> the set of all positive even numbers less than
      13</sq>. I could similar define <sq>the set of all divisors of
      1044</sq> or <sq>the set of all prime numbers between 100 and
      1000</sq>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, all the sets I've describe have been
      <term>finite</term>: they have finitely many elements. I can
      also define infinite sets. <sq>The set of all prime
      numbers</sq>, for example, is an infinite set, since there are
      infinitely many prime number. For some infinite sets, I can
      describe them by listing a pattern, using the same three-dot
      notation and I previous discussed to showing pattern. The set of
      all positive even numbers, for example, can be described as
      follows.  
      <me>
        E = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, \ldots \}
      </me>
      The symbol <sq><m>\lots</m></sq> means that the pattern
      continues without end. The even numbers never stop, but this set
      contains all of them. So, $105538 \in E$ and $194942734 \in E$,
      because both are even numbers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The last impotant idea to mention for sets is the idea of a
      subset. A <term>subset</term> of some set is a selection of some,
      but perhaps not all, of the elements of the set. It is written
      with the notation <m>\subset</m>. I looks like this in explicit
      notation.
      <me>
        {2,9,13,17} \subset {0,2,5,9,13,17,20}
      </me>
      This is a true statement since the set on the left containts a
      selection of the elements from the set on the right. It is a
      subset of the larger set. This can also work for infinite sets.
      All multiples of 10 are even, so the set of all multiple of 10
      is a subset of the positive even numbers. I can write this with
      pattern notation.
      <me>
        {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, \ldots} \subset \{2,4,6,8,10,12,\ldots\}
      </me>
      I would also write this explicitly with words.
      <me>
        \text{The set of multiple of 10\} \subset \text{The set of
        positive even numbers} 
      </me>
      If I want to say that something is not a subset, I can write a
      cross through the symbol, much as I did for the <sq>is an
      element of </sq> symbol. 
      <me>
        {1,7,44} \notsubset \{2,4,7,15,22,28,34,44\}
      </me>
      This is not a subset since 1 is an element of the first but not
      of the section. The first set includes something apart from the
      second set, to it cannot be a selection of elements from the
      second.

    <title>Notations for Numbers</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="section-number-line" />, I defined several types
      of number. There are some standard notations for the sets of
      these numbers. 
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        The natural numbers:
        <me>
          \NN = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,\ldots\}
        </me>
      </li>
      <li>
        The integers:
        <me>
          \ZZN = \{\ldots -3,-2,-1,01,2,3,\ldots\}
        </me>
      </li>
      <li>
        The rational numbers: <m>\QQ</m>
      </li>
      <li>
        The real numbers: <m>\RR</m>
      </li>
    </ul></p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-intervals">
    <title>Intervals of the Number Line</title>
    <p>
      There is another type of number set that I need to menion, since
      it is used frequenctly in mathematics. These are the intervals
      of the number line.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <term>interval</term> is a connected piece of the number
      line. They are defined by all number between two endpoint. So,
      for example, an interval could be all real numbers between
      <m>-2</m> and <m>7</m>, os all real numbers between
      <m>\frac{-3}{7}</m> and <m>\frac{4}{11}</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the previous paragraphs, <sq>between</sq> is slightly vague,
      since it doesn't specify whether the edges are included. Both
      possibilities are allowed, so let me now be more precise, as
      well as defining the notation. In the following, I'll use
      <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> to be any real numbers as long as <m>a \lt
      b</m>. 
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        The notation <m>[a,b]</m> means all real numberse between
        <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, including the endpoints. It is all
        numbers <m>x</m> such that <m>a \leq x \leq b</m>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The notation <m>(a,b)</m> means all real numberse between
        <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, not including the endpoints. It is all
        numbers <m>x</m> such that <m>a \lt x \lt b</m>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The notation <m>[a,b)</m> means all real numberse between
        <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, including the left endpoint. It is all
        numbers <m>x</m> such that <m>a \leq x \lt b</m>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The notation <m>(a,b]</m> means all real numberse between
        <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, including the right endpoint. It is all
        numbers <m>x</m> such that <m>a \lt x \leq b</m>. 
      </li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>
      In these notations, a square brackets always indicates inclusion
      of the end points, and a curve paranthesis always indicates
      exclusion of the end points. The interval without endpoints,
      <m>(a,b)</m> is called an <term>open interval</term>. The
      interval with endpoints, <m>[a,b]</m> is called a
      <term>closed interval</term>. The other two, <m>(a,b]</m> and
      <m>[a,b)</m> are called <term>half-open</term>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If I want to visualize the intervals on the number line, I use
      dots for included endpoints, and open circles for excluded
      endpoints. (ADD FIGURE)
    </p>
    <p>
      The intervals I've discussed so far were all bounded: numbers
      between some fixed lower endpoint and some other fixed upper
      endpoint. However, intervals can also be unbounded. 
    </p>
    <p><ul> 
      <li>
        The interval
        <me>
          [a,\infty)
        </me>
        is all numbers that are greater than or equal to <m>a</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The interval
        <me>
          (a, \infty) 
        </me>
        is all numbers that are greater than <m>a</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The interval
        <me>
          (-\infty, a]
        </me>
        is all numbers that are less than or equal to <m>a</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The interval
        <me>
          (-\infty, a) 
        </me>
        is all numbers that are less than <m>a</m>. 
      </li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>
      For the finite piece of this, the notation is the same as
      before. Square brackets are used to indicate that the endpoint
      is included and curved paranthesis are used to indicate the the
      endpoint is excluded. For the unbounded sides of the intervals,
      the symbol <m>\infty</m> is used. This is a tricky symbol, since
      it is used for a variety of related by distinct purposes in
      different pieces of mathematics. Here, it simply means that the
      interval goes on forever. <m>\infty</m> means larger and larger
      positive numbers, without ever stopping. <m>-\infty</m> means
      larger and larger negative numbers, without even stopping. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In particualr, <m>\infty</m> here is certainly not a number. I'm
      not going to put it in any equations or do any arithmetic with
      it. Instead, it is a short-hand meaning that the interval
      extends without bound in some direction (positive or negative).
      This is reflected in the notation: only curve paranthesis are
      used for the infinite end of an unbounded interval. Square
      brackets can never be used, since that indicates that the
      endpoint is included <mdash /> but infinite intervals has no
      endpoint, so no endpoint can possibly be included. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I could write the interval <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m>.
      This is an unbounded interval on both sides, extending without
      bound to larger and larger positive and negative numbers. This
      is simply the entire number line. I have already given a
      notation for the number line: <m>\RR</m>, since the number line
      is a visualization of all the real numbers. Therefore, I can
      write <m>\RR = (-\infty,\infty)</m>, and either notation is
      acceptable for talking about all the real numbers.
