      Once we are comfortable with variables, there are a variety of
      useful techniques, tools and tricks for manipulating expressions
      involving constants and variables. In this module, we'll go over
      a selection these tools and tricks. The first is various forms
      of factoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Factoring comes from the properties of multiplication of
      numbers. Consider this simple addition.
      <me>
        12 + 15 = 27
      </me>
      All of the terms are divisible by 3, so we can write them as
      multiples of 3. 
      <me>
        (3)(4) + (3)(5) = 27
      </me>
      Factoring is pulling the 3 out of the entire expression (using
      the distributive law).
      <me>
        3(4 + 5) = 27
      </me>
      Thus we have isolated the common factor, 3, from the left side
      of the equation. We could then divide both sides by this
      isolated 3. 
      <me>
        4 + 5 = \frac{27}{3} = 9 
      </me>
    </p>

    <title>Factoring with Variables</title>
    <p>
      Factoring is not terribly intense with numbers. We are more
      interesting in factoring with variables. However, when we factor
      with variables, we are not doing anything essentially different
      from what we just did here with numbers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a vareity of situations where we might want to factor
      out a variable. We might be solving an equation where we can
      remove a variable.
      <me>
        x^2 - 5x = 9x 
      </me>
      Here, we can factor the variable <m>x</m> out of the left side
      of the equation.
      <me>
        x(x - 5) = 9x 
      </me>
      If we used the distributive law to distribute the factored
      <m>x</m> again, we would recover the original expression. (If
      you want to check if you've done your factoring correctly,
      multiply the factor back in and see that it matched the original
      expression.) After factoring, we can divide by the variable
      <m>x</m> to lead to an easier equation. 
      <me>
        x - 5 = 9  \implies x = 9 + 5 = 14
      </me>
      This gives us the solution <m>x=14</m>. However, we also have
      the solution <m>x=0</m>. It is important to remember anytime you
      divide by a variable, or cancel off a variables (which is the
      same thing), you have to consider the alternatively possibility
      that the variable might be zero. Our equation here has two
      solutions: <m>x = 14</m> and <m>x = 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes we might want to factor something out of the numerator
      and denonminator of a fraction to try to simplify the fraction.
      Here is an example, where <m>p</m> is the variable. 
      <me>
        \frac{p^3 + 4p}{p^2 -7p}
      </me>
      The variable is a common factor to both numerator and
      denominator, so we can factor it out of both. 
      <me>
        \frac{p(p^2 + 4)}{p(p -7)}
      </me>
      Then, since <m>p</m> is a factor of the whole numbers and of the
      whole denominator, we can cancel it out. 
      <me>
        \frac{p(p^2 + 4)}{p(p - 7)} = \frac{p^2+4}{p - 7} 
      </me>
      The reason why we can do this is that any expression
      <m>\frac{p}{p}</m> evaulates to 1 (assuming that <m>p \neq
      0</m>). Multiplying by 1 does do anything, so the fraction with
      and the fraction with <m>\frac{p}{p}</m> is the same thing. 
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-factoring-binomials">
    <title>More Complicated Factors</title>
    <p>
      We can do more than just factor out a variable. Sometimes we can
      factor out a binomial (such as <m>(x-9)</m>), or some other more
      complicated expression. The more complicated the term, the more
      difficult it can be to recognize the factor. There are no
      simply, algorithmic rules for this kind of factors. Much of the
      skill comes from practice and familiarity with a variety of
      mathematical situations. I'll give a couple examples here, but
      don't assume that all problems will look like these examples;
      they are meant to demonstrate but not be representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      First let's look at an expression where we can factor out a
      binomial. 
      <me>
        4x^2 - 2x + 4x - 2 
      </me>
      Here there is a pattern with repeated 4s and 2s. I'm going to
      try to produce a common binomial in the first two and second two
      terms by factoring. 
      <me>
        x(4x - 2) + 1(4x - 2)
      </me>
      Applying the distributive law to both of these factors would
      produce the original expression (in the second, multiplying by 1
      has no effect). Then, if we think of the term (4x-2) as a thing,
      we have <m>x</m> times that thing plus 1 times that thing.
      Therefore, we can write this expression as 
      <me>
        (x + 1)(4x - 2)
      </me>
      This is a factorization of the original expression. Both the
      binomials <m>(x+1)</m> and <m>(4x-2)</m> are factors of the
      expression. This is an example of factoring a quadratic, which
      is discussed in more detail in a future chapter.  For now, let
      me make one more point on this example. Say we had this
      quadratic.
      <!--

      is discussed in more detail in <xref ref="chapter-polynomials1"
      />. For now, let me make one more point on this example. Say we
      had this quadratic.
      -->
      <me>
        4x^2 + 2x - 2 
      </me>
      Then, in the middle, I could add <m>2x</m> and subtract the
      same, which doesn't change anything. (I can add and subract any
      quantity I want; adding and subtracting the same thing has no
      effect on any expression.) 
      <me>
        4x^2 - 2x + 2x + 2x - 2 
      </me>
      Now I can group the third and fourth terms. 
      <me>
        4x^2 - 2x + 4x - 2 
      </me>
      Now I have the same expression that I started with, which
      factors as above. Therefore, I can conclude that 
      <me>
        4x^2 + 2x - 2 = (x + 1)(4x - 2)
      </me>.
      The point of this remark is that often various ways to factor an
      expression are hidden. Helpful factorizations are often not
      obvious and can, in fact, be very difficult to find. As I said
      before, this isn't algorithmic. Sometimes, creativity and
      persistence is required to find the right way to manipulate an
      expressions.

    -->
    <p>
      Sometimes we need want to factor things out of a square root (or
      other root). Let's start with numbers and consider this square
      root. 
      <me>
        \sqrt{40}
      </me>
      We can write 40 as <m>(4)(10)</m>. 
      <me>
        \sqrt{(4)(10)}
      </me>
      Then it is a property of square root (since they are essentially
      exponents), using the properties of exponents (which will be
      developed in a  future chapter) that we can split up a square root
      over multiplication or division.

      ref="chapter-exponents1" />) that we can split up a square root

      -->
      <me>
        \sqrt{(4)(10)} = (\sqrt{4})(\sqrt{10})
      </me>
      Then we can evaluate the first part: the square root of 4 is 2.
      <me>
        2 \sqrt{10}
      </me>
      What we have done here is essentially factored out 4 from the
      square root. But when we took it out of the square root, we had
      to apply the square root, so 4 became 2. This is a useful
      technique for writing square roots in simply form, since any
      factor which has a nice square root can be removed. Here are a
      couple more examples. 
      <me>
        \sqrt{700} = \sqrt{(100)(7)} = 10 \sqrt{7} 
      </me>
      <me>
        \sqrt{320} = \sqrt{(64)(5)} = 8 \sqrt{5} 
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can do the same thing with variables and roots. Here is an
      expression with variables inside a square root. 
      <me>
        \sqrt{x^4 - x^2} 
      </me>
      We can factor the term inside the square root.
      <me>
        \sqrt{x^2(x^2 - 1)} 
      </me>
      Then we can split up the square root over the multiplication.
      <me>
        \sqrt{x^2}\sqrt{x^2 - 1} 
      </me>
      Then we can get rid of the first square root, as we did with
      numbers above. However, there is a subltety here with variables.
      We can't just write <m>\sqrt{x^2} = x</m>. If the variable
      turned out to have a negative value, say -3, then we would
      square it to produce 9 and square root to produce 3. We would
      have lost the negative sign. To recognize this, we use the
      absolute value of the variable (discusssed in more detail in
      <xref ref="section-absolute-value" />). 
      <me>
        \sqrt{x^2}\sqrt{x^2 - 1} = |x| \sqrt{x^2 - 1}
      </me>
      We've factored the <m>x^2</m> out of the square root; in the
      process, by applying the square root, it became <m>|x|</m>.

    <title>Some Distribution Cautions</title>
    <p>
      The distributive law of multiplication/division over
      subtraction/addition is fundamental. In my experience, it is
      intuitively well understood by most students. In this section, I
      want to talk about the danger of that intuitive understanding.
      Because distribution seems so natural and reasonable, students
      will often try to distribute where it isn't appropriate. This
      section is a series of cautions about overuse of the
      distributive law. 
    </p>
    <p>
      First to recap. Distribution is necessay for multiplication and
      division.
      <me>
        \frac{1}{4} (9 + 15) = \frac{9}{4} + \frac{15}{4} 
      </me>
      If we do the addition give, we get <m>9 + 15 = 24</m>, and then
      dividing by 4 gives 6. If we distribute, we get a sum of
      fraction (discussed in <xref ref="chapter-fractions1" />). The
      sum of fraction, using common denominator, gives
      <m>\frac{24}{6}</m>, which is again 6. The distributive law
      works here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider these next two expression.
      <me>
        \sqrt{16 + 9} ?=? \sqrt{16} + \sqrt{9}
      </me>
      This looks like distribution: we've distributed the square root
      over the sum of the two numbers. However, let's check the
      values. The left side, if we do the sum, is <m>\sqrt{25} =
      5</m>. The right side, when we do the square roots and then the
      sum, is <m>4 + 3 = 7</m>. 5 is not 7, so these are not equal. 
      <me>
        \sqrt{16 + 9} \neq \sqrt{16} + \sqrt{9}
      </me>
      I could restate this with variables. 
      <me>
        \sqrt{a + b} \neq \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}
      </me>
      With variable, this might be less obvious. That brings me to an
      important point. 
      <blockquote>
        IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IS AN ALGEBRAIC MANIPULATION WORKS, TRY
        INSERTING NUMBERS FOR THE VARIABLES AND SEE IF IT HOLDS.
      </blockquote>
      Algebraic expression with variables mean something when the
      variables are replaced with numbers. I find that many student
      get into the habit of treating manipulations of rules with
      symbols while forgetting what those symbols stand for. Taking
      some time to put in some numbers and check is a nice reminder
      tha all algebraic expressions actually mean something about
      numbers. We know that distribution doesn't work for square roots
      because if we put in in <m>a = 16</m> and <m>b = 9</m>, we get 5
      on the left and 7 on the right, which are not equal. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Square roots are not the only place where students often use
      distribution incorrectly. Here are some other common places
      where distribution fails. For all of these, we show the problem
      by choosing numbers for the variables and explicitly calculating
      the right and left sides. We will get different values, so the
      two sides cannot be equal.

    <title>Simplification</title>
      <p>
        This factoring is one of the many techniques in algebra that
        is covered by the vague and tricky verb <qt>simplify</qt>. I
        can't give you a perfectly clean understanding of this term,
        since it is inherently a bit vague. It means, in general, to
        manipulate a mathematical expression to turn it into a form
        that is easier: easier to understand, easier to work with in
        the future, easier to compare to other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often, if there is a common factor to a number of terms, it
        will be easier to understand the expression in factor form.
        Therefore, often simplify will involve factoring as discussed
        in this section. It may also involve other techniques -- it's
        not just factoring. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish I could be more concrete about how to simplify, but no
        one simplification system applies to all situation. How and when to
        simplify is much more a matter of experience and practice.
