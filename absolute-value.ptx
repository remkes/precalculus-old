    <title>What is Absolute Value</title>
    <p>
      The absolute value of a number <m>x</m>, written <m>|x|</m>, is
      a relatively simple thing to define: if <m>x</m> is positive,
      then absolute value does nothing; if <m>x</m> is negative,
      absolute value makes it positive. In functional notation, we
      could write this as a piecewise function.
      <me>
        |x| = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 
          x \amp x \geq 0 \\
          -x \amp x \lt 0 
        \end{matrix} \right. 
      </me>
      Here are some simple examples.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          |4| \amp = 4 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          |-7| \amp = 7 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          |0| \amp = 0 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          |\sqrt{17}| \amp = \sqrt{17}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \left| \frac{-55}{107} \right| \amp = \frac{55}{107} 
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Absolute value is a useful little tool when we don't care about
      whether a number is positive or negative, but just want to know
      how large it is. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute value is natural suited to questions of change. For
      example, we could wonder which day in a certain place had the
      greatest temperature change. An increase would be positive and
      a decrease would be negative, but we only care about the
      greatest span in temperatures, so we would take the absolute
      value to get a positive answer. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute value is also very useful for questions of distance.
      The distance between two number <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> (on the
      number line, say) is given by <m>|a-b|</m>. This was, we don't
      have to know, in advance, whether <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is larger
      to talk about the distance between them.

    <title>Solving with Absolute Value</title>
    <p>
      Sometime we have to solve with absolute value in equalities or
      inequalities. Since absolute value has different behaviours for
      positive and negative numbers, we usually have to split up the
      equation or inequality into two pieces. For any absolute value,
      we have two cases: whether the thing inside the absolute value
      is negative or positive. In symbols, let <m>|\star|</m>
      represent an absolute value, where <m>\star</m> is some
      mathematics expression (a number, a variable, a combination of
      numbers and variables, etc). 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Case 1: when <m>\star \geq 0</m> we simply drop the abolute
          value (replace <m>|\star|</m> by simply <m>\star</m>) and
          continue to solve. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Case 1: when <m>\star \lt 0</m> we multiply the absolute
          value term by <m>(-1)</m> (replace <m>|\star|</m> by
          <m>(-1)\star</m>) and continue to solve. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      In each case, when we get a solution, we have to check that the
      solution fits with the range of each case. Any solutions which
      are out of the range of the case that produced them are invalid. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's demonstrate this by examples. 
      <me>
        |x + 3| = 7 
      </me>
      We have two cases. The first case is when the term inside the
      asbolute value is positive: <m>x + 3 \geq 0</m>. Equiavlently,
      <m>x \geq -3</m>. In this case, we can drop the absolute value,
      since the thing inside it is always positive. 
      <me>
        x + 3 = 7 
      </me>
      Then we solve to get <m>x=4</m>. When we find a solution like
      this, we need to check that it part of the case are consiering.
      The current case is <m>x \geq -3</m>, so <m>x = 4</m> is a fine
      solution and we can accept it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we procedd with the second case, when the term inside the
      absolute value is negative. This happens when <m>x \lt -3</m>. 
      In this case, when I drop the absolute value, I have to multiply
      by <m>(-1)</m>, since multiplying a negative value by a negative
      makes it positive. 
      <me>
        (-1)(x + 3) = 7 
      </me>
      We can solve this by multiplying by <m>(-1)</m>.
      <me>
        x + 3 = -7 
      </me>
      Then we finish by subtracting <m>3</m> from both sides, giving a
      solution og <m>x = -10</m>. This solution first our case, since
      <m>-10</m> is less than <m>-3</m>. In total, we conclude that
      there are two solutions: <m>x = 4</m> and <m>x = -10</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's take a very similar example
      <me>
        |x - 10| = 4
      </me>
      We solve in cases again. For the first case, we need the
      expression inside the absolute value to be positive. This
      happens when <m>x \geq 10</m>. In this case, we can drop the
      absolute value.
      <me>
        x - 10 = 4
      </me>
      Then we can solve and find <m>x = 14</m>. Since <m>14</m> is
      greater than <m>10</m>, this is a valid solution for our first
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we look at the second case, when the term inside the
      absolute value is negative. This happens when <m>x \lt 10</m>.
      In this case, we multiply by <m>(-1)</m> in place of the
      absolute value, since multiplying a negative by a negative makes
      it positive. 
      <me>
        (-1)(x - 10) = 4
      </me>
      Then we can solve by multiplying both sides by <m>-1</m> and
      adding 10 to both sides. We get <m>x = 6</m>. This value is
      within the range for this second case, since <m>6</m> is less
      than <m>10</m>, so this is a valid solution. We conclude we have
      two solutions: <m>x = 6</m> and <m>x = 14</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This example was very similar to the previous, but it has an
      important interpretation. The absolute value <m>|x-10|</m> can
      be interpreted as the distance between the numbers <m>x</m> and
      <m>10</m>. So the equation <m>|x-10| = 4</m> ask which numbers
      are <m>4</m> away from <m>10</m>; the answer, unsurprisingly,
      are the two numbers <m>6</m> and <m>14</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To further make this point, here are two more examples.
      <me>  
        |x- 15| = 12
      </me>
      This is all numbers which are <m>12</m> away from <m>15</m>:
      these must be <m>x=3</m> and <m>x = 27</m>. 
      <me>  
        |x + 7| = 9
      </me>
      We can rewrite this as a subtraction.
      <me>  
        |x - (-7)| = 9
      </me>
      This is all numbers which are <m>9</m> away from <m>-7</m>:
      these must be <m>x=2</m> and <m>x = -16</m>. 
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-absolute-value-inequalities">
    <p>
      We can also have absolute values in inequalities. Consider this
      example.
      <me>
        |x-4| \gt 6
      </me>
      As with equalities, we work in cases, depending on whether the
      expression inside the absolute value is positive or negative.
      The first cases is <m>x \geq 4</m>, where we can just drop the
      absolute value.
      <me>
        x-4 \gt 6
      </me>
      Then we can solve normally. Adding <m>4</m> to both sides of the
      equation give <m>x \gt 10</m>. Therefore, in the case <m>x \geq
      4</m>, the inequality describes all number larger than or equal
      to 10. All those numbers are also larger than 4, so they all fit
      the case. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second case, when <m>x \lt 4</m>, the term in the
      absolute value is negative, so we multiply by <m>(-1)</m> to make
      it positive. 
      <me>
        (-1)(x-4) \gt 6
      </me>
      Now we have to solve. We first multiply both sides by
      <m>(-1)</m>, which reverses the inequality. 
      <me>
        x-4 \lt -6
      </me>
      Then adding <m>4</m> to both sides of the equation gives <m>x
      \lt -2</m>. The solution consists of all numbers stritcly less
      than <m>-2</m>. Our case is <m>x \lt 4</m>, and all number less
      than <m>-2</m> are also less than <m>4</m>, so all these numbers
      fit the case. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We conclude that the original inequality describes two sets of
      numbers: all number strictly larger than <m>10</m> and all
      number strictly less than <m>-2</m>. The solution consists of
      both collections of numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The left side of the original inequality can be interpreted as
      the distance between <m>x</m> and <m>4</m>. Therefore, this is
      describe all numbers which are at least <m>6</m> away from
      <m>4</m> on the number line. Above <m>6</m>, that is all numbers
      larger than <m>10</m>, and below <m>6</m>, that is all numbers
      less than <m>-2</m>, as we found. In this interpretation, it
      makes sense that there should be two ranges, one above and one
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inequalities with absolute value can be more complicated, of
      course. Here is another example which mostly illustrates how
      messy inequalities and absolute values can get. At several
      points, we'll have to carefully think through what the various
      inequalities mean and how to proceed reasonably. 
      <me>
        |x^2 - 8|^2 + 9 \lt 25
      </me>
      First we'll subtract <m>9</m> from both sides.
      <me>
        |x^2 - 8|^2 \lt 16 
      </me>
      When we square root both sides. This preserves the inequality
      because both sides are positive. Since the absolute value is
      positive, we don't need to worry about the possible negative
      square root here. 
      <me>
        |x^2 - 8| \lt 4 
      </me>
      Now that we've worked our way down to the absolute value term,
      we can now work in two cases. In the first case, the term inside
      the absolute value is positive. This happens when <m>x^2 \geq
      8</m>. This case covers <m>x \geq \sqrt{8}</m>, but also <m> x
      \leq -\sqrt{8}</m>. In this case, we can just drop the absolute
      value.
      <me>
        x^2 - 8 \lt 4 
      </me>
      Then we can solve. First we add <m>8</m> to both sides.
      <me>
        x^2 \lt 12
      </me>
      Then we take the square root. We get <m>x \lt \sqrt{12}</m>.
      However, as discussed in <xref
      ref="subsection-inequalities-squareroots" /> we also need <m>x \gt
      -\sqrt{12}</m>. Finally, we have to compare this to the numbers
      that this case works for.  This case is all number <m>x \geq
      \sqrt{8}</m> and <m>x \leq \sqrt{8}</m>. Matching this solution
      to the case gives us two collections of numbers:
      <me>
        -\sqrt{12} \lt x \leq \sqrt{8} \text{ and }
        \sqrt{8} \leq x \lt \sqrt{12} 
      </me>.
      In interval notation (as described in <xref
      ref="chapter-real-numbers" />):
      <me>
        \left( -\sqrt{12}, -\sqrt{8} \right] \cup 
        \left[ \sqrt{8}, \sqrt{12} \right)
      </me>
      That's the first case. For the second case, we consider the
      situation where the term inside the inequality is negative. This
      happens if <m>x^2 \lt 8</m>. In the square root, this is <m>x
      \lt \sqrt{8}</m>, but also <m>x \gt -\sqrt{8}</m>, so that
      <m>x</m> is also not a large negative number. We can express
      this case as one range: <m>-\sqrt{8} \lt x \lt \sqrt{8}</m>. In
      this case, the absolute value become multiplication by
      <m>-1</m>. 
      <me>
        (-1)(x^2 - 8) \lt 4 
      </me>
      Then we can solve. First we multiply by <m>(-1)</m>, which
      reverses the inequality.
      <me>
        x^2 - 8 \gt -4 
      </me>
      Then we add <m>8</m> to both sides.   
      <me>
        x^2 \gt 4 
      </me>
      Then we square root to get <m>x \gt 2</m>. However, as discussed
      in <xref ref="subsection-inequalities-squareroots" /> we also
      need <m>x \lt -2</m>. So we get two ranges of numbers, those
      above <m>2</m> and those below <m>-2</m>.  However, our case was
      restricted to those numbers between <m>-\sqrt{8}</m> and
      <m>\sqrt{8}</m>. But that together, this case gives two groups
      of numbers:
      <me>
        -\sqrt{8} \leq x \lt -2 \text{ and }
        2 \lt x \leq \sqrt{8} 
      </me>.
      In interval notation (as described in <xref
      ref="chapter-real-numbers" />):
      <me>
        \left[ -\sqrt{8}, -2 \right) \cup 
        \left( 4, \sqrt{8} \right]
      </me>
      Now we have to put it all together. The two cases together
      describe four collections of numbesr, but those collections of
      number can be combined. The first case gave us negative number
      from <m>-\sqrt{12}</m> to <m>-\sqrt{8}</m> and then the second
      case gave us negative number from <m>\sqrt{8}</m> to <m>-2</m>.
      Together we get the range from <m>-\sqrt{12}</m> to <m>-2</m>.
      The same is true for the positive ranges; they fit together on
      either side of <m>\sqrt{8}</m>. All in all, the solution to this
      inequality is the two collection of numbers described by 
      <me>
        -\sqrt{12} \lt x \lt -2 \text{ and }
        2 \lt x \lt \sqrt{12} 
      </me>.
      In interval notation (as described in <xref
      ref="chapter-real-numbers" />):
      <me>
        \left( -\sqrt{12}, -2 \right) \cup 
        \left( 4, \sqrt{12} \right)
      </me>
      That is the solution to the inequality. You can see that the
      organizating and bookkeeping, with multiple cases and multiple
      intervals for each case, get a bit hectic.
