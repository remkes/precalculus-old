    <title>Inequalities as Questions</title>
    <p>
      When I talked about equations with varibles in <xref
      ref="section-variables" />, I said that an equation with a
      variable was implicity a question. The queation
      <me>
        4x - 7 = 12
      </me>
      was implicit the question: what number(s), when we multiply by 4
      and then subtract 7, result in 12? An inequality is also a
      question. If we make this equality an inequality, 
      <me>
        4x - 7 \lt 12
      </me>
      we are asking the question: what numers, when we mulitply by 4
      and then subtrat 7, are less than 12? 
    </p>
    <p>
      The major difference, now, is that we expect many more answers
      (in general). There might be only one number which satisfies the
      equation, but infinitely many numbers which satisfy the
      inequality. This raising the question of how to represent these
      large gets of numbers. For the purposes of this section, we'll
      just represent them using the inequalities themslves. It I want
      to talk about all the numbers larger than 5, I can just talk
      about all <m>x</m> such that <m>x \gt 5</m>. In <xref
      ref="chapter-real-numbers" />, we'll talk about other notations
      for set of numbers, including set notation and interval
      notation.

      For now, sovling inequalities will be simply tryin go write the
      inequalities in a consise form. Let's consider the example
      we started with above. 
      <me>
        4x - 7 \lt 12
      </me>
      To write this in a more succint form, let's do some
      manipulations, keeping in mind the rules about what operations
      perserve and reverse inequalities. First, I'll add 7 to both
      side; addition and subtration were operations that preserved
      inequalities. 
      <me>
        4x \lt 21
      </me>
      Then I'll divide by sides by 4. Division by positive numbers is
      also an operation that preserve inequalities. 
      <me>
        x \lt \frac{21}{4}
      </me>
      This is a reasonable answer. The originaly inequality describes
      (is solved by!) all numbers which are strictly larger than
      <m>\frac{21}{4}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is another example. 
      <me>
        15 - 6x  \geq 42
      </me>
      First, I'll subtract 15 from both sides. Subtraction preserves
      inequalities. 
      <me>
        - 6x  \geq 35
      </me>
      Then I'll divide both sides by <m>-6</m>. Dividing by a negative
      number reverses inequalities, so I'll reverse the notation.
      <me>
        x  \leq \frac{35}{-6} = - \frac{35}{6} 
      </me>
      The set of number specified by this inequality is all number
      less than <m>- \frac{35}{6}</m>. That's a reasonable description
      of this set of numbers, so that is a solution to the inequality. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <me>
        9x - 4 \lt 17x + 5 
      </me>
      <p>
        I can add 4 to both sides of the inequality, which preserves
        the inequality. 
        <me>
          9x \lt 17x + 9 
        </me>
        Now I can subtract <m>17x</m> from both sides of the
        inequality, which preserves the inequality.
        <me>
          -8x \lt 9 
        </me>
        Now I can divide by <m>-8</m>, which reverses the inequality.
        <me>
          x \lt \frac{9}{-8} = - \frac{9}{8} 
        </me>
        This solves the inequality. The original expression is
        satisfied by all <m>x</m> which are less than
        <m>-\frac{9}{8}</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <me>
        \sqrt{6x-4} \geq 17 
      </me>
      <p>
        To get rid of the square root, we need to square both sides.
        That's an exponential operation, so it  preserves inequalities
        only if both sides of the inequality are positive. Here, that
        is the case: 17 is positive and the square root is a positive
        number. We square both sides of the inequality. 
        <me>
          6x-4 \geq 289
        </me>
        Then we can add <m>4</m> to both sides, which preserve the
        inequality.
        <me>
          6x \geq 293
        </me>
        Finally, we divide by <m>6</m>, which also preserves the
        inquality because <m>6</m> is positive. 
        <me>
          x \geq \frac{293}{6}
        </me>
        This gives us a solution to the inequality: all number greater
        than or equal to <m>\frac{293}{6}</m>. Before we finish this
        example, though, we have one subtlety to mention. We need the
        square root at the start of the problem to be possible, to the
        term in side the square root cannot be negative: <m>6x-4 \geq
        0</m>. We can solve this inequality similarly to get <m>x \geq
        \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}</m>. In our solution of <m>x \geq
        \frac{293}{6}</m> is more restrictive, since
        <m>\frac{293}{6}</m> is much later than <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>, so
        the square root restrict is satisfied by our solution. 
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <me>
        x^2 + 6 \geq 3 
      </me>
      <p>
        First, we can subtract 6 from both sides, which preserves the
        inequality.
        <me>
          x^2 \geq -3
        </me>
        If we were solving an equation, at this point we would try to
        square root both sides. That wouldn't work too well, since we
        can't take square roots of negative numbers. However, this is
        an inequality, so we don't need the precise equality. The
        right side is a square, which is always positive. All positive
        numbers are greater than <m>-3</m>. Therefore, we can conclude
        that this inequality is satisfied by all possible numbers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This example hopefully makes the point that when solving
        inequalities, we can't be to mechanistic about it. We can't
        just walk through a series of mechanical steps; we have to
        stop and think about what the inequality means and what it
        would entail for numbers to satisfy it. A mechanical approach
        to this equation would try to take a negative square root,
        fail, and stop, missing the fact that all numbers already
        satisfy the inequality.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <me>
        x^2 + 6 \geq 10 
      </me>
      <p>
        This is very similar to the previous example, but we avoid the
        negative square root when we start with <m>10</m> on the right
        side. The first step is the same: we can subtract 6 from both
        sides, which preserves the inequality.
        <me>
          x^2 \geq 4 
        </me>
        Then we can square root both side. The square root is an
        exponent and both sides are positive, so it preserves the
        inequality. 
        <me>
          x \geq 2 
        </me>
        We see that all numbers greater than or equal to <m>2</m>
        satisfy the inequality. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, here again there are subtleties that a mechanical
        approach might miss. When we took the square root, we didn't
        consider the possibility that <m>x</m> might be a negative
        number. This is more complciated, since the square of a
        negative becomes positive. Therefore, any slightly large negative
        numbers, such as <m>-10</m>, have squares larger than 4 (in
        this case, <m>(-10)^2 = 100</m>. Since the negative square
        become positive, we have a reveral of inequalities. The
        solution includes the numbers above, which are larger than
        <m>2</m>, but also all negative numbers less or equal to
        <m>-2</m>. If <m>x \leq -2</m>, then its square must be at
        least 4, satisfying the original equality. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You might ask: why didn't I give a rule about squares, square
        roots and negative numbers. I could have given such a rule;
        however, if I followed in that direction, I'd end up with a
        monumental list of rules for manipulating inequalities in a
        variety of situations. This isn't really how most mathematics
        is done; instead, we build up some practice and intuition
        about inequalities and carefully think about what each
        individual inequality means. It's more conceptual and less
        mechanistic. That makes is trickier to learn and teach -- I
        can't just give you all the rules and algorithms -- but such
        is the nature of mathematics.
