    <title>Inequalities as Questions</title>
    <p>
      When I talked about equations with varibles in <xref
      ref="section-variables" />, I said that an equation with a
      variable was implicity a question. The queation
      <me>
        4x - 7 = 12
      </me>
      was implicit the question: what number(s), when we multiply by 4
      and then subtract 7, result in 12? An inequality is also a
      question. If we make this equality an inequality, 
      <me>
        4x - 7 \lt 12
      </me>
      we are asking the question: what numers, when we mulitply by 4
      and then subtrat 7, are less than 12? 
    </p>
    <p>
      The major difference, now, is that we expect many more answers
      (in general). There might be only one number which satisfies the
      equation, but infinitely many numbers which satisfy the
      inequality. This raising the question of how to represent these
      large gets of numbers. For the purposes of this section, we'll
      just represent them using the inequalities themslves. It I want
      to talk about all the numbers larger than 5, I can just talk
      about all <m>x</m> such that <m>x \gt 5</m>. In <xref
      ref="chapter-real-numbers" />, we'll talk about other notations
      for set of numbers, including set notation and interval
      notation.

      For now, sovling inequalities will be simply tryin go write the
      inequalities in a consise form. Let's consider the example
      we started with above. 
      <me>
        4x - 7 \lt 12
      </me>
      To write this in a more succint form, let's do some
      manipulations, keeping in mind the rules about what operations
      perserve and reverse inequalities. First, I'll add 7 to both
      side; addition and subtration were operations that preserved
      inequalities. 
      <me>
        4x \lt 21
      </me>
      Then I'll divide by sides by 4. Division by positive numbers is
      also an operation that preserve inequalities. 
      <me>
        x \lt \frac{21}{4}
      </me>
      This is a reasonable answer. The originaly inequality describes
      (is solved by!) all numbers which are strictly larger than
      <m>\frac{21}{4}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is another example. 
      <me>
        15 - 6x  \geq 42
      </me>
      First, I'll subtract 15 from both sides. Subtraction preserves
      inequalities. 
      <me>
        - 6x  \geq 35
      </me>
      Then I'll divide both sides by <m>-6</m>. Dividing by a negative
      number reverses inequalities, so I'll reverse the notation.
      <me>
        x  \leq \frac{35}{-6} = - \frac{35}{6} 
      </me>
      The set of number specified by this inequality is all number
      less than <m>- \frac{35}{6}</m>. That's a reasonable description
      of this set of numbers, so that is a solution to the inequality.
