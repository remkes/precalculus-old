    <title>Conceptual Questions</title>
    <p>
      The current section is just a conceptual question: no algorithms
      or calculation techniques were covered here. Therefore, for this
      section, the only activity are the conceptual questions.

        <ul>
          <li>
            What is the difference between natural number, integers,
            rational numbers and real numbers?
          </li>
          <li>
            Why are the rational number not complete?
          </li>
          <li>
            Why is the continuum and why is continuity of a line
            important
          </li>
          <li>
            Why does the problem of the continuum involve infinity,
            even though it just wants to describe a ordinary line
            drawn between two points?
