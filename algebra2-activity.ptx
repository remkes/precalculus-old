    <title>Factoring Out a Variable</title>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve by factoring out a variables and cancelling. Maybe
          sure to note any extra solutions produced by cancelling.  
          <me>
            9x^2 + 3x = 12x^2
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We factor the variable <m>x</m> out of each side. 
          <me>
            x(9x + 3) = x(12x)
          </me>
          Then we can cancel of (or equivalently divide by) the
          variable. 
          <me>
            9x + 3 = 12x
          </me>
          Then we solve. Here, I'll subtract <m>9x</m> from both sides
          of the equation.
          <me>
            3 = 3x
          </me>
          Dividing by 3 gives the solution <m>x=1</m>. Since we
          divided by the variable, we must also consider the
          possibility that <m>x=0</m>. If we put <m>x=0</m> in the
          origina equation, we get <m>0=0</m>, which is true, so
          <m>x=0</m> is a second solution. 
        </p>
      </solution>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve by factoring out a variables and cancelling. Maybe
          sure to note any extra solutions produced by cancelling.  
          <me>
            7t^2 + 8t^3 = 3t^2
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Here the lowest power of the variable is <m>t^2</m>, so we
          can factor that out of both sides of the equation.
          <me>
            t^2(7 + 8t) = t^2(3)
          </me>
          Then we can cancel off (or equivalently divide by)
          <m>t^2</m>. 
          <me>
            7 + 8t = 3
          </me>
          Then we solve by subtracting 7 from both sides of the
          equation.
          <me>
             8t = -4
          </me>
          Finally, we divide by 8.
          <me>
             t = \frac{-4}{8} = \frac{-1}{2} 
          </me>
          Again, since we divided by <m>t^2</m>, we must consider the
          possibility that <m>t=0</m>. This value satisafy the
          original equation, so we conclude that <m>t=0</m> is a
          second solution. 
        </p>
      </solution>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve by factoring out a variables and cancelling. Maybe
          sure to note any extra solutions produced by cancelling.  
          <me>
            4l^3 + 8l = 20l
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can factor out <m>l</m> from both sides of the equation.
          <me>
            l(4l^2 + 8) = l(20)
          </me>
          We can cancel off (or equivalently divide by) <m>l</m>. 
          <me>
            4l^2 + 8 = 20
          </me>
          Then we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation.
          <me>
            4l^2 = 12
          </me>
          Then we can divide by 4. 
          <me>
            l^2 = 3
          </me>
          Finally, to isolate the variable, we have to take the square
          root of both sides.
          <me>
            l = \pm \sqrt{3}
          </me>
          The notation <m>\sqrt{3}</m> is implicity positive, but we
          could also have the variable be the negative square root.
          Therefore, we write <m>\pm \sqrt{3}</m> for both possible
          solutions.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Simplify this square root by factoring out a factor which a
          reasonable square root. 
          <me>
            \sqrt{150}

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We need to find a factor of 302 which has a nice square
          root. We can do this by trial an error, trying small square
          numbers (trying factors of 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on). We
          would first find that 25 is s a factor which has
          a nice square root. 
          <me>
            \sqrt{150} = \sqrt{(25)(6)}
          </me>
          Then we can split up the square root.
          <me>
            \sqrt{25} \sqrt{6}
          </me>
          Then we can evaluate the square root of 25.
          <me>

        <p>
          We need to find a factor of 392 which has a nice square
          root. We can do this by trial and error, trying small
          values. We find that 49 is a factor which has a nice square
          root. (Again, I just did this by testing small factors with
          nice square roots: 4,, 9, 16, and so on). 
          <me>
            \sqrt{343} = \sqrt{(49)(7)}
          </me>
          Then we split up the square root. 
          <me>
            \sqrt{49}\sqrt{7}
          </me>
          Then we evalute the square root of 49.

            7 \sqrt{7}

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Factor a variable out of this square root expression.
          <me>
            \sqrt{9z^2 + 13z^3}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can see that <m>z^2</m> is a factor of both terms in the
          square root, so we factor that out.
          <me>
            \sqrt{z^2(9 + 13z)}
          </me>
          Then we can split up the square root. 
          <me>
            \sqrt{z^2}\sqrt{9 + 13z}
          </me>
          Then we can evalute the first square root. 
          <me>
            |z| \sqrt{9 + 13z}
          </me>
          Now we've factor out a variable and simplified the square
          root.

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Factor a variable out of this square root expression.
          <me>
            \sqrt{u^4 - u^3}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The term <m>u^3</m> is a factor of both terms under the
          square root. However <m>u^3</m> isn't a term we can
          reasonable take out of a square root: there isn't a nice
          square root of a cube. Instead, I'll factor <m>u^2</m> out
          of both terms. 
          <me>
            \sqrt{u^2 (u^2 - u)}
          </me>
          Then we can split up the square root. 
          <me>
            \sqrt{u^2} \sqrt{u^2 - u}
          </me>
          Then we can evalute the first square root. 
          <me>
            |u| \sqrt{u^2 - u}
          </me>
          Now we've factored a variable out of the square root and
          simplified the square root expression.
