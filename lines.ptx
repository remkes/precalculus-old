      <xref ref="section-plane" /> reviewed or introduced the
      Cartesian plane. Once we have coordiantes, we can use them to
      describe geometric objects. The first object we want to describe
      are straight lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      By convention, the first horizontal coordinate is called the
      <m>x</m>-coordinate and the second horizontal coordinate is
      called the <m>y</m>-coordinate. If we have an algebraic equation
      in the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, then we can interpret
      that equation as a geometric shape. Let me explain with an
      example. 
      <me>
        y = \frac{1}{2} x + 2
      </me>
      This is an equation in the two variables. For any point
      <m>(x,y)</m>, we can ask whether the point satisfies the
      equation by substituting it in and seeing if the right side and
      left side match. Try the point <m>(4,0)</m> by replacing the
      <m>x</m> with <m>4</m> and the <m>y</m> with <m>0</m>. 
      <me>
        0 = \frac{1}{2} 4 + 2
      </me>
      The left side is <m>0</m> and the right side works out to
      <m>4</m>. Since <m>0</m> is not equation to <m>4</m>, the point
      <m>(4,0)</m> does not satisfy the equation, therefore will not
      be on the corresponding shape. Now try the point <m>(-2,1)</m>. 
      <me>
        1 = \frac{1}{2} (-2) + 2
      </me>
      The left side is <m>1</m> and the right side works out to <m>-1
      + 2 = 1</m>. Both give the same value, so this point satisfies
      the equation. Therefore <m>(-2,1)</m> will be a point on the
      corresponding shape. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out there are infinitely many points that will satisfy
      this equation and that, if we draw all these points, we get a
      line. <xref ref="figure-line1" /> shows the line with several
      points indicated. You are free to check that all the label
      points do, in fact, satisfy the equation of the line.

      We can make many equations in the variales <m>x</m> and
      <m>y</m>, giving many types of shapes in the plane. In this
      review, we are interested only in straight lines. The equation
      we used an exanmple above gave a line, but we would like to know
      how to describe any line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any equation where the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> show up
      simply multiplied by a constant and then added or subtracted
      from another constant produces a line. By <qt>simply</qt>, I
      mean that no other operations (other than multiplication by a
      constant) are performed on the variables: no exponents, no
      roots, no functions, nothing else.  These equations, since they
      produce lines, are called linear equations. Here are some
      examples.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = 7x - 9 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          5y + 4x - 10 \amp = 0
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \frac{1}{5} y - \frac{2}{7} x - \frac{5}{17} \amp = 0 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \sqrt{7}y \amp = \pi x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{19}}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      In all these equations, all we have done is multiplied each
      varaible by come constant. Then we can add and subtract the
      variables, possibly with another constant, but no other
      operationrs are performed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If we wanted a general form, then let the symbols <m>a_1</m>,
      <m>a_2</m> and<m>a_3</m> stand for constants. We could bring
      everything over to one side of the equation and write the
      general form of an equation of a line this way:
      <me>
        a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 = 0 
      </me>
      This is a reasonable general form. All lines in the plane can be
      described by these equations. However, this is not the most
      intuitive form. I'm going to work towards another form, which
      may be familiar to you. To get there, we need to review another
      important concept. 
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-slope">
    <title>Slope</title>
    <p>
      The slope of a straight line is a measure of its steepness. A
      large slope descrbes a steep line -- one that is quickly
      increasing. A small slope describes a shallow line -- one that
      is slowly increasing. A negative slope describes a decreasing
      line. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A line with a slope of zero is a horizontal line: it does not
      increase or decrease at all. A vertical line has no slope at
      all: we say that its slope is undefined. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To calculate the slope, we take choose any two points on the
      line. On the line from <xref ref="section-plane" />, we could
      choose the point <m>(2,3)</m> and <m>(6,5)</m>. We calculate the
      difference in the <m>y</m> coordinates and call this the
      <em>rise</em>: it measures how far up the line goes between the
      two points. Then we calculate the difference in the <m>x</m>
      coordinates and call this the <em>run</em>: it measures how far
      we move horizontally between the two points. The slope is then
      the rise divided by the run. 
      <me>
        \text{Slope} = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}} =
        \frac{5-3}{6-2} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
      </me>
      This line has slope <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. The geometry of this
      calculation is show in <xref ref="figure-slope" />
      <figure xml:id="figure-slope">
        <caption>Slope of the Line <m>y = \frac{1}{2} x + 2</m></caption>
        <image width="90%" source="images/figure03"/>
      </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
      This method of calculation shows us again why veritcal lines
      have no slope. The <m>x</m> coordinates of any two points on a
      vertical line are the same, to the run would be zero. To
      calculate the slope would involve division by zero, which is not
      defined. Therefore, vertical lines have no slope. 
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-slope-intercept">
    <title>Slope Intercept Form</title>
    <p>
      Now that we have defined slope, we can review/introduce a
      special way of writing the equations of lines. Go back to the
      four example lines above; in each of these, I will re-arrange
      the equation so that <m>y</m> is along on the left side. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = 7x - 9 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = - \frac{4}{5} x + 2
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = \frac{10}{7} x + \frac{25}{17} 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{7}} x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{19}\sqrt{7}}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      I can describe the general form we get by solving for <m>y</m>
      on the left. Let <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> represent constant (the
      choice of these letters if conventional and used in many
      places). Then all of these equations have this form:
      <me>
        y = mx + b 
      </me>
      In this form, the number <m>m</m> will always be the slope of
      the line. The number <m>b</m> will be the <m>y</m>-coordinate of
      the point where the line crosses the <m>y</m> axis; this is
      called the <m>y</m>-intercept. These two pieces of information
      are enough to complete determine the line: if we know where it
      crosses the <m>y</m>-axis and we know how quickly is grows from
      that point (its slope), then we know everything we need to
      determine the line. <xref ref="figure-slope-intercept" /> shows
      an example to illustrate this slope-intercept form.
      <figure xml:id="figure-slope-intercept">
        <caption>Slope-Intercept Form </caption>
        <image width="90%" source="images/figure04"/>
      </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
      Before finishing this section, I want to briefly talk about two
      special cases. First, a horizontal line has a slope of zero.
      Therefore, in slope-intercept form, <m>m = 0</m>, so the
      equation of the line look like
      <me>
        y = 0x + b = b 
      </me>
      Horizontal lines have equations <m>y = b</m> for some constant.
      All we need to specify if the <m>y</m> coordinate. <m>y = 4</m>
      is the horizontal line where the <m>y</m>-coordinate is always
      <m>4</m>, and the <m>x</m>-coordinate can be anything
      whatsoever. <xref ref="figure-horizontal-lines" /> shows some
      horizontal lines. 
      <figure xml:id="figure-horizontal-lines">
        <caption>Horizontal Lines</caption>
        <image width="90%" source="images/figure05"/>
      </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
      We've said several times that a vertical line has no slope and
      cannot be expressed in slope-intercept form. However, the
      previous paragraph gives us a good idea of how to understand
      vertical lines. If a horizontal line is simply determined by its
      <m>y</m> coordinate, a vertical line is similarly determined by
      its <m>x</m> coordinate. Any line of the form <m>x = b</m> is a
      horizontal line. <m>x - -3</m> is the horizontal line of points
      with <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>-3</m> and any <m>y</m> coordinate
      whatsoever. <xref ref="figure-vertical-lines" /> shows some
      horizontal lines.

    <title>Calcluating Equations of Lines</title>
    <p>
      We often need to calculate the equation of a line gives various
      pieces of information about this line. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If we are give the slope and the <m>y</m>-intercept, we just
        put those numbers directly into the slope-intercept form. For
        example, if we wanted the line with slope <m>\frac{-2}{5}</m>
        and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>3</m>, we would simply put those
        numbers into the form and get the equation of the line
        <me>
          y = \frac{-2}{5} x + 3 
        </me>
      </li>
      <li>
        Sometimes we are given a point and a slope. For example, say
        we wanted the equation of the line with slope <m>4</m> that
        goes through the point <m>(2,2)</m>. We have the slope, so we
        can put that in place of <m>m</m> in the slope intercept form.
        <me>
          y = 4x + b 
        </me>
        The <m>y</m>-intercept is still unknown. However, if we put in
        the point, we can solve for <m>b</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            y \amp = 4x + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2 \amp = (4)(2) + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2 \amp = 8 + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            -6 \amp = b 
          </mrow>
        </md>
        That gives us a value for the <m>y</m>-intercept, hence the
        equation of the line.
        <me>
          y = 4x - 6 
        </me>
        This process works for any line give a slope and a point: put
        the slope into the slope-intercept form, put the point in for
        the coordinates <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and solve for the
        intercept. 
      </li>
      <li>
        There is one last way of describing a line: by giving two
        point. There is a unique line passing between any two points
        -- but how do we get the equation of this line? We calculate
        the slope. Recall that slope is defined as the fraction rise
        over run. Rise is the different in the <m>y</m> coordinates
        and run is the different in the <m>x</m> coordinates, so give
        two points we can calculate the slope. I'll show this by
        example: what is the line through the point <m>(3,-5)</m> and
        <m>(1,1)</m>? First I'll calculate the slope
        <me>
          m = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}} = \frac{-5 - 1}{3 - 1} =
          \frac{-6}{2} = -3
        </me>
        The slope is <m>-3</m>, so the slope intercept looks like
        <me>
          y = -3x + b 
        </me>.
        Then the process is the same as the previous case: we have the
        slope and we have a point (two, in fact). We put in a point
        (either point will work) to calculate the intercept.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            y \amp = -3x + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            -5 \amp = (-3)(3) + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            -5 \amp = -9 + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            4 \amp = b 
          </mrow>
        </md>
        With the intercept, we can write the equation of the line.
        <me>
          y = -3x + 4
        </me>
        I'll leave it up to you to check that if I had used the other
        point, I would have calculated the same value for <m>b</m>. 
      </li>
