  <title>The Concept of a Function</title>

    <title>What Is A Function</title>
    <p>
      The idea of a function is one of the most fundamental, most
      basic ideas in mathematics. A great deal of mathematics is
      expressed in the language of functions. In particular, calculus
      is entirely a study of functions. So what is a function?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three productive ways to answer the question. A
      function is a complicated enough idea that it's best to give you
      all three concepts. The concept of a function that you build in
      your mind should include all these of these ideas.
    </p>
    <p><ol>
      <li>
        First, a function is like a machine which acts on things
        (usually, but not necessarily, numbers). Functions are agents
        which perform certain actions. The function <m>f(x) = x^2</m>
        is a process which takes a number and produces the square of
        that number. I can think of this <m>f</m> as the machine that
        squares numbers. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Second, a more abstract understanding of a function is as a
          rule that assigns something in one set to something in
          another set.  (I reviewed the idea and notation of sets in
          <xref ref="subsection-sets" />).  Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>
          be sets. A function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> takes elements
          of <m>A</m> and assign, to each of these elements, exactly
          on element of <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, functions encode relationships and dependencies.  For
        a function <m>f<m> from a set <m>A</m> to a set <m>B</m>, I
        can thing of the elements of <m>B</m> depending on the
        elements of <m>A</m>. This idea is reflected in the phrase
        <dq>is a function of</dq>. If I say that population growth is a
        function of food supply, I mean that there is a function which
        goes from numbers representing food supply to numbers
        representing growth rates. That function encodes the
        dependance of growth on food supply.
      </li>
    </ol></p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-function-notation">
    <title>Function Notation and Examples</title>
    <p>
      I'm going to start but going over function notation, and the
      demonstrate that notation with a bunch of examples. Mathematics
      has a variety of ways to represent function, but the following
      is the most typical.
      <me>
        f(x) = 7x^2 - 9 
      </me>
      In this notation <m>f</m> is the name of the function. I can us
      this letter to refer to the function by talking about <sq>the
      function <m>f</m></sq>. The notation <sq><m>(x)</m></sq> tells
      me what the function is acting on. The thing inside the brackets
      can either be a variable, as it here with the letter
      <sq><m>x</m></sq>, or it could be a number or even a complicated
      expression. The main idea is that the bracket surround the think
      on which the function is going to act. Whatever is in the 
      brackets is the input to the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I write <m>f(x) = </m> with a variable, the right side of
      the equation is going to give the process. Here the process is
      <m>= 7x^2 - 9</m>. That means that this function takes its
      input, represented by the variable <m>x</m>, square it,
      multiplied it by <m>7</m> and then subtracts <m>9</m> (following
      the usual order of operations, of course). 
    </p>
    <p>
      That's the basic notation: a function has a name or symbol used
      to refer to is, here <m>f</m>; a repesentation of the input put
      inside brackets, here <m>x</m>; and, after an equals sign, an
      expression which describes what the function actually does.  
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-function-domain">
    <title>Domain and Range of Functions</title>
    <p>
      In the abstract understanding of functions (the second of the
      three notions in the previous section), a function is a rule
      that goes between two sets. These two sets have names: the soure
      or input of the function is called the <term>domain</term> of
      the function, and the set of possible outputs is called the
      <term>codomain</term> of the function. There is also a notation
      for this: if <m>A</m> is the domain and <m>B</m> is the
      codomain, a function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> is written as
      follows.
      <me>
        f: A \rightarrow B
      </me>
      Unlile the previous notation, this notation doesn't yet tell me
      what the function does. It only tells me that <m>f</m> is going
      to be some function that has inputs from the set <m>A</m> and
      outputs in the set <m>B</m>. I'll look at some examples now.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the function
        <me>
          f: \NN rightarrow \NN
        </me>
        defined by the formula
        <me>
          f(x) = x+3
        </me>
        The domain and codomain of this function are both the natural
        numbers. For each whole positive number, adding three still
        gives a whole, positive number. The outputs of this function
        are in <m>\NN</m>
        whole 
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the function
        <me>
          f: \ZZ \rightarow \NN
        </me>
        defined by the formula
        <me>
          f(x) = x^2 + 1
        </me>
        This function claims to go from the integers to the nutural
        numbers. Does it? For positive whole numbers, the square is
        still a positive square number and adding one still gives a
        positive square number. 3 goes to 10, 4 goes to 17, 5 goes to
        26, and so on. This all works fine. But the domain here also
        includes negative numbers and zero. Does this also work for
        those inputs?
      </p>
      <p>
        0 is sent to 1, so that does work. For any negative <m>-n</m>,
        the square <m>(-n)^2 = n^2</m> is positive. Then adding 1
        still gives a positive number. Therefore, zero and the
        negatives are also sent positive whole numbers. This function
        is valid: it outputs are, indeed, all in <m>\NN</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the function
        <me>
          f: \QQ \rightarrow \QQ
        </me>
        defined by the formula
        <me>
          f(x) = x - \frac{1}{2}
        </me>
        This function takes any fraction and subtracts
        <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. By the arithmetic of fractions (as
        discussed in <xref ref="subsection-fraction-addition" />),
        adding or subtracting two fractions works by common
        denominator and always produces a new fraction. Therefore, the
        output here is still a rational number and the function is
        valid as presented. 
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the function
        <me>
          f: \NN \rightarrow \RR
        </me>
        defined by the formula
        <me>
          f(x) = \sqrt{x}
        </me>
        This function takes any positive whole number to is square
        root. This neads to be a function with codomain <m>\RR</m>,
        because many square root of whole numbers are irrational. 
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the function
        <me>
          f: [2, \infty) \rightarrow [0, \infty)
        </me>
        defined by the formula
        <me>
          f(x) = x-2
        </me>
        This function takes real numbers and subtracts 2 from them.
        The codomain reflects this subtraction: the starting numbers
        are all 2 or larger, so subtracting 2 means that the output
        are all 0 or larger. 
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the function
        <me>
          f: (0,1) \rightarrow (1, \infty) 
        </me>
        defined by the formula
        <me>
          f(x) = \frac{1}{x} 
        </me>
        This function takes a real number to its reciprocal. If <m>x
        \lt 1</m>, then taking reciprocals flips inequalities (as
        discussed in <xref ref="subsection-inequalities-reversing"
        />), so <m>\frac{1}{x} \gt 1</m>. The domain is positive
        number less than one, so the outputs, by this logic, must be
        greater than one. The codomain reflects this, since the
        interval <m>(1,\infty)</m> is all positive numbers greater
        than 1. 
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      If I look back over the examples, I can notice that not all the
      numbers in the codomains are actually realized as outputs of the
      function. This is an important distinctions: the codomains is
      a set of  <em>possible</m> outputs, but not the set of
      <em>actual</em> outputs. The set of actual outputs is called the
      <term>range</term> of the function. It always a subset of the
      codomain, but it might be a smaller subset. Let me go back
      through the examples to see what the range of each function is. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the function
        <me>
          f: \NN rightarrow \NN
        </me>
        defined by the formula
        <me>
          f(x) = x+3
        </me>
        Since I am adding three, the outputs are always larger than
        the inputs. The smallest imput is 1, but the largest output is
        4. Therefore, the range of this function is <m>\{4, 5, 6, 7,
        \ldots\},</m>. This is a subset of <m>\NN</m>, but not the
        whole codomain.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the function
        <me>
          f: \ZZ \rightarow \NN
        </me>
        defined by the formula
        <me>
          f(x) = x^2 + 1
        </me>
        The outputs of this function are numbers which are one larger
        than the square numbers. That list is <m>\{1, 5, 10, 17, 26,
        37, 50, \ldots \}. This is the range of the function, which is
        missing most of <m>\NN</m>, the codomain. 
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the function
        <me>
          f: \QQ \rightarrow \QQ
        </me>
        defined by the formula
        <me>
          f(x) = x - \frac{1}{2}
        </me>
        For any fraction, I can add <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> and also have a
        fraction. Therefore, all fractions show up in the outputs of
        this function. The range here is <m>\QQ</m>, the same as the
        comdomain. 
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the function
        <me>
          f: \NN \rightarrow \RR
        </me>
        defined by the formula
        <me>
          f(x) = \sqrt{x}
        </me>
        The range here is the square roots of the natural numbers. I
        could write this as a list: <m>\{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, 2,
        \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{6}, \sqrt{7}, \sqrt{8}, 3, \sqrt{10} \ldots
        \}<m>. This is a comparatively small subset of the codomain
        <m>\RR</m>, since most real numbers are not in this list. 
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the function
        <me>
          f: [2, \infty) \rightarrow [0, \infty)
        </me>
        defined by the formula
        <me>
          f(x) = x-2
        </me>
        This function essentially shifts all real numbers down by 2.
        Therefore, it will cover the entire interval <m>[0,
        \infty)</m>: all of this set will be outputs, so here, again,
        the codomain and the range are the same. 
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the function
        <me>
          f: (0,1) \rightarrow (1, \infty) 
        </me>
        defined by the formula
        <me>
          f(x) = \frac{1}{x} 
        </me>
        For any number in <m>(0,1)</m>, its reciprocal is in
        <m>(1,\infty)</m>. However, the reverse is also true: for any
        number in <m>(1, \infty)</m>, its reciprocal is in
        <m>(0,1)</m>. Therefore, the outputs of the function will be,
        in fact, the entire interval <m>(1, \infty)</m> and, again,
        the range and the codomain here are the same. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, the range of a function is usually difficult to
        determine. Based on algebraic techniques (that is, without
        calculus), it is often prohibitively difficult to do more than
        guess the range. Among its many other applications, calculus
        provides tools for precisely calculating range.
      </p>
    </example>

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-determining-domains">
    <title>Determining Domains of Functions</title>
    <p>
      Often when a function is introduced in some mathematical
      situation, the domain is not stated. Instead, it is left
      implicit. In these cases, the domain is usually assumed to be
      the largest set of number it can be. When asked to calculate the
      domain of a function, this is precisely what I need to do:
      determine the largest possible domain that works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determinign the largest possible domain is mostly done by
      considering restriction: what operations are impossible and what
      inputs to the function would lead to these impossible
      operations? While certain special functions have their own
      restrictions, for most common functions there are three main
      things to worrk about.
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        I cannot divide by zero.
      </li>
      <li>
        I cannot take even roots of negative numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        I cannot take logarithms of negative numbers or zero.

    </ul></p>

    <title>Restricting Domains of Functions</title>
    <p>
      In addition, should I wish to, I can put additional domain
      restrictions on a function. This can be done for mathematical
      reasons, but most often, this is a practical consideration.
