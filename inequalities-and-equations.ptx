    <title>Equality and Inequality</title>
    <p>
      I made a big deal in <href ref="section-variables" /> of the
      idea of equality as a central concept in mathematics,
      particularly the notion of preserving equality by treating both
      sides of an equal the same under any operation. We have
      something very similar for inequalities as well. As a basic
      reminder, we have four inequality operations.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Greater than: <m>\gt</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Less than: <m>\lt</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Greater than or equal to: <m>\geq</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Less than or equal to: <m>\leq</m>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      For the first two (<m>\lt</m> and <m>\gt</m>), if we want to
      point out that equality is not included, we will often say
      <emph>stricky</emph> greater than or less than. 
    </p>
    <p>
      An inequality is any expression involving one of the four
      inequality opartions. Like an equation, it has a left side and a
      right side, related by the inequality. For example
      <me>
        4y^2 - 9 > 12
      </me>
      describes the set of all numbers (represented by the variable
      <m>y</m> such that when we square the number, mutilply by 4 and
      subtract 9, the result is (strictly) greater than 12. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Working with inequalities is very much like working with
      equations. In equations, we said we could perform any operation
      as long as we performed the same operation to both sides of the
      equation, so that we preserved the equality. Here we have
      something similar but slightly more restrictive. 
      <blockquote>
        We can perform any operation to an inequality as long as it is
        it performed to both sides of the equation and <emph>it is an
        operation which preserved inequalities</emph>.
      </blockquote>
      Unlike equality, not all operations preserve inequalities. We
      need to make a cataloge of those operation which are allowed --
      operations which preserve the inequality.

      Here is a list of operations that preserve inequalities, each
      with a brief example

          Addition and subtraction.

          Note that exponents can easily fail to preserve inequality
          is one of the sides is not positive.

      Some operations reverse inequalities instead of preserving them.
      We can also work with these operations when we manipulate
      inequalities if we remember to reverse the inequalities. For
      common problems, there are two operations that reverse
      inequalities.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mulitplication or division by negative numbers.

        </li>
        <li>
          Negative exponents, as long as both sides of the inequality
          are positive. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              3 \amp \lt 5

          As a special case of the previous operation, appyling the
          exponent <m>-1</m> is the same as taking the reciprocal of
          both sides. We can think of that as its own operation.
          Taking the reciprocal of an inequality reverses the
          inequality. In general, this still requires that the terms
          are both positive; however, it also works when the terms are
          both negative. It can fail when one term is positive and one
          is negative.

    <p>
      In the language of <xref ref="chapter-functions1" /> and <xref
      ref="chapter-functions2" />, any function which is decreasing
      will reverse an inequality when applied to both sides. However,
      many operations neither preserve or reverse inequalitys. For
      example, we cannot usually apply a trigonometric function to an
      inequailty, since trigonometric functions oscillate up an down.
      We can't expect any consistent behaviour with these functions
      applied to inequalities.
