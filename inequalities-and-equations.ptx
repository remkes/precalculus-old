    <p>
      I made a big deal in <href ref="section-variables" /> of the
      idea of equality as a central concept in mathematics,
      particularly the notion of preserving equality by treating both
      sides of an equal the same under any operation. We have
      something very similar for inequalities as well. As a basic
      reminder, we have four inequality operations.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Greater than: <m>\gt</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Less than: <m>\lt</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Greater than or equal to: <m>\geq</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Less than or equal to: <m>\leq</m>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      For the first two (<m>\lt</m> and <m>\gt</m>), if we want to
      point out that equality is not included, we will often say
      <emph>stricky</emph> greater than or less than. 
    </p>
    <p>
      An inequality is any expression involving one of the four
      inequality opartions. Like an equation, it has a left side and a
      right side, related by the inequality. For example
      <me>
        4y^2 - 9 > 12
      </me>
      describes the set of all numbers (represented by the variable
      <m>y</m> such that when we square the number, mutilply by 4 and
      subtract 9, the result is (strictly) greater than 12. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Working with inequalities is very much like working with
      equations. In equations, we said we could perform any operation
      as long as we performed the same operation to both sides of the
      equation, so that we preserved the equality. Here we have
      something similar but slightly more restrictive. 
      <blockquote>
        We can perform any operation to an inequality as long as it is
        it performed to both sides of the equation and <emph>it is an
        operation which preserved inequalities</emph>.
      </blockquote>
      Unlike equality, not all operations preserve inequalities. We
      need to make a cataloge of those operation which are allowed --
      operations which preserve the inequality.

    <title>Reversing Inequalities</title>
    <p>
      Some operations reverse inequalities instead of preserving them.
      We can also work with these operations when we manipulate
      inequalities if we remember to reverse the inequalities. For
      common problems, there are two operations that reverse
      inequalities.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mulitplication or division by negative numbers.

        <li>
          As a special case of the previous operation, appyling the
          exponent <m>-1</m> is the same as taking the reciprocal of
          both sides. We can think of that as its own operation.
          Taking the reciprocal of an inequality reverses the
          inequality. In general, this still requires that the terms
          are both positive; however, it also works when the terms are
          both negative. It can fail when one term is positive and one
          is negative.

      In the language of functions (deveoped in a future chapter),
      any function which is decreasing
      will reverse an inequality when applied to both sides. However,
      many operations neither preserve or reverse inequalitys. For
      example, we cannot usually apply a trigonometric function to an
      inequailty, since trigonometric functions oscillate up an down.
      We can't expect any consistent behaviour with these functions
      applied to inequalities.

    <title>Square Roots</title>
    <p>
      I want to make a special discussion of square root, since they
      show up frequently enough that they are worth considering and
      they present a bit of challenge. Consider this inequality.
      <me>
        z^2 \lt 9 
      </me>
      We take take the square root of both sides of the inequality.
      <me>
        z \lt 3 
      </me>
      This looks good: if <m>z</m> is less than 3, then when we square
      it, <m>z^2</m> should be less than 9. However, <m>z \lt 3</m>
      also includes all the negative numbers; for many large negative
      numbers, their square beocmes positive and will be larger than
      9. This is a problem. We need another restriction. The result of
      the square root is, in fact, two inequalities.
      <me>
        -3 \lt z \lt 3 
      </me>
      Only when <m>z</m> is between <m>-3</m> and <m>3</m> will its
      square be less than <m>9</m>. I can state this generally. If
      <m>x</m> is a variable and <m>a</m> is a positive number, the
      inequality 
      <me>
        x^2 \lt a
      </me>
      is equivalent to the double inequality 
      <me>
        -\sqrt{a} \lt x \lt \sqrt{a}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For greater than inequalities we have something similar as well.
      Consider an example first.
      <me>
        t^2 \geq 16 
      </me>
      If we square root, we get <m>t \geq 4</m>. That certainly works;
      numbers larger than <m>4</m> have square larger than <m>16</m>.
      However, there are also some negative numbers than have square
      (which are positive!) which are larger than <m>16</m>. We also
      need <m>t \leq -4</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I'll state this generally. If <m>x</m> is a variable and
      <m>a</m> is a positive number, then the inequality 
      <me>
        x^2 \gt a
      </me>
      is equivalent to the double inequality 
      <me>
        x \gt \sqrt{a} \text{ and } x \lt -\sqrt{a}
      </me>
    </p>
