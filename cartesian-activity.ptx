          Write the equation of the line with <m>y</m>-intercept

          We just need to put the slope and the intercept into the
          slope-intercept form of the equation of a line.

          Write the equation of the line with slope <m>-2</m> that goes
          through the point <m>(1,1)</m>.

          I start by putting the slope into into the slope-intercept
          form.
          <me>
            y = (-2) x + b 
          </me>
          I need to figure out the intercept. I can do this by putting
          the point into equation and solving for <m>b</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              y \amp = -2x + b

            <mrow>

              3 \amp = b 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          That gives me the value for the intercept, so I can finish
          the equation of the line.

          I start by putting the slope into into the slope-intercept

              \frac{7}{2} \amp = b

          That gives me the value for the intercept, so I can finish
          the equation of the line.

          First I need to calculate the slope. I can do this by taking
          the difference of the <m>y</m> coordinates (the rise) and
          dividing by the difference of the <m>x</m> coordinates (the
          run). 
          <me>
            m = \frac{5 - 1}{5 - 0} = \frac{5}{4} 
          </me>
          Now that I have the slope, I can put it into the
          slope-intercept form.
          <me>
            y = \frac{5}{4} x + b

          I need to figure out the intercept. I can do this by putting
          either point into equation and solving for <m>b</m>.

            <mrow>
              5 \amp = \frac{25}{4} + b

              \frac{-5}{4} \amp = b

          That gives me the value for the intercept, so I can finish
          the equation of the line.
