      A fraction is an expression with one number (or more complicated
      mathematical expression) written over another
      <me>
        \frac{3}{7} \text{ or } \frac{x^2-1}{9 - \sqrt{x}} 
      </me>
      The top piece of a fraction is called the <em>numerator</em>
      and the bottom piece is called the <em>denomninator</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In mathematics, we use the fraction notation <m>\frac{a}{b}</m>
      for (at least) two related and intertwined ideas. First,
      fractions are the familiar parts that are taught in elementary
      mathematics: <m>\frac{3}{5}</m> is <m>3</m> parts, each part being one
      fifth of the whole. Second, as discussed in <xref
      ref="section-arithmetic" />, fractions are also the most common
      division notation: instead of writing <m>3 \div 5</m>, we
      usually write <m>\frac{3}{5}</m>. So the fraction notation,
      in addition to meaning <m>3</m> parts with each part being a fifth of
      the whole, also means the result of dividing <m>3</m> by
      <m>5</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      These two uses are related and intertwined, of course. If we
      want to write numers in decimal notation, then the division <m>3
      \div 5 = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6</m>. But a fifth of a whole is
      <m>0.2</m> and so <m>3</m> fifths is <m>3 \times 0.2 = 0.6</m>.
      So both concepts, in some sense, refer to the number <m>0.6</m>;
      indeed, <m>\frac{3}{5}</m> is just as good a way of writing this
      number as <m>0.6</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following review of fraction arithmetic, we don't want to
      present the rules of fractions as arbitrary symbol manipulation.
      All the rules relate back to these two concepts: they are the
      rules for combining parts of a whole, as well as the rules for
      doing various arithmetic combinations with division.

    <title>Some Notations and Comments</title>
    <p>
      A fraction where the numerator is smaller than the denominator
      (<m>\frac{4}{11}</m>) is called a <em>proper fraction</em>.
      A fraction where the numerator is larger thatn the denominator
      (<m>\frac{13}{11}</m>) is called a <em>improper
      fraction</em>/. 
      In much of elementary arithmetic, students are encouraged to
      write improper fractions as mixed fractions. Here is an example. 
      <me>
        \frac{9}{4} = 2 \frac{1}{4} 
      </me>
      This is certainly a nice notation if we want a sense of the size
      of the number: it's easier to see that this is a bit more than
      <m>2</m> in mixed form. However, mixed fractions are more
      difficult to work with in most situation. In university
      mathematics, for the most part, we are usually quite happy to
      write improper fraction and we mostly avoid mixed fractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes a fraction might have a square root (or other root) in
      its denominator (<m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}</m>). In many high-school
      situations, students are encourage to <qt>rationalize the
      denominator</qt> (<m> \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} =
      \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}</m>). For university mathematics, there is no
      need to do this. We are perfectly happy with square roots in
      denominators. (Indeed, I really have no idea where this
      high-school tendency to want rational denominators comes.) 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes fractions have common factors in the numerator and
      denominator.
      <me>
        \frac{25}{10}
      </me>
      In this case, there is a common factor of <m>5</m>. We have a
      very important rule for manipulation fractions that applies
      here.
      <blockquote>
        IF WE MUTLIPLY OR DIVIDE BOTH THE NUMERATOR AND DENOMINATOR OF
        A FRACTION BY ANYTHING (EXCEPT ZERO), THE FRACTION IS
        UNCHANGED.
      </blockquote>
      In our example, we can divide both the numerator by <m>5</m>.
      <me>
        \frac{25}{10} = \frac{5}{2} 
      </me>
      A fraction where the numerator and denominator have no common
      fractors is said to be written in <term>lowest terms</term>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes we don't want fractions in lowest terms. In the next
      section in particular, it will be useful to go the other way: to
      multiply both nuemrator and denominator by some number to change
      the fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      For another notational note, we can move negative signs around
      fraction. 
      <me>
        \frac{-4}{5} = \frac{4}{-5} = - \frac{4}{5}
      </me>
      All these of these things mean the same thing. In decimal form,
      they all correspond to the number <m>-0.8</m>. This kind of
      notational change, where we move this negative sign around
      fractions, is the kind of thing that is often done automatically
      and without comment in many calculation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Division by <m>1</m> has no effect: dividing something
      into one part doesn't change it. Therefore, if we have a
      fraction with a denominator of <m>1</m>, we can simply write it
      as a whole number.
      <me>
        \frac{7}{1} = 7 
      </me>
      We can go the other way as well. Sometime we may want to write a
      whole number as a fraction, so we simply make its denominator
      <m>1</m>.
      <me>
        -37 = -\frac{37}{1}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, some of you may be familiar with the term
      <qt>cross-multiply</qt> from certain operations with fractions
      (or from other operations in algebra). I'm going to very
      intentionally avoid this term. In my experience, it has two many
      different meanings in different settings and will often just
      confuse students. Moreoever, it tends to be a mechanical
      term which hides the concepts behind the operation. If you
      remember the term and it serves you well, but all means continue
      to use it, but I'll avoid it in these notes.

    <title>Addition and Subtraction</title>
    <p>
      The addition and subtraction of fractions relies on having a
      common denominator. The priciple of the common denominator is
      that we want to add and subtract the same kind of things. In
      their simple form, <m>\frac{4}{5}</m> and <m>\frac{7}{3}</m> are
      not thing that can be added together: they are not comparable.
      Using common denominator puts them in a form where we can
      reasonable compare: instead of looking at thirds and fifths and
      being confursed, we can look at fifteenths and fifteenths and
      understand how to related them to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating a common denominator uses the rule from the previous
      section: we can mulitply the numerator and denominator of any
      fraction by a non-zero number without changing the fraction. In
      our example, we can multiple the first fraction by <m>3</m> (the
      denominator of the other fraction).
      <me>
        \frac{4 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{12}{15} 
      </me>
      We can multiplicy the numerator and denominator of the second
      fraction by <m>5</m> (the denominator of the first fraction).
      <me>
        \frac{7 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{35}{15} 
      </me>
      Now both of the fractions are expressed in fifteenths. In this
      form they are comparables and can be added or subtracted. Here
      is addition.
      <me>
        \frac{4}{5} + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{12}{15} + \frac{35}{15} = 
        \frac{12 + 35}{15} = \frac{47}{15}
      </me>
      Subtraction is similar.
      <me>
        \frac{4}{5} - \frac{7}{3} = \frac{12}{15} - \frac{35}{15}
        \frac{12 - 35}{15} = \frac{-23}{15}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the example above, we made a common denominator out of the
      product of the two denominators. The first denominator was
      <m>5</m> and the second was <m>3</m>. We multiplied the first
      fraction by <m>3</m> and the second by <m>5</m>, so that the
      denominator of both is <m>15</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The choice to multiply each fraction by the denominator of the
      other fraction will always work. It will always produce a common
      denominator which is the product of the two original
      denonimanors. However, sometimes there is a more efficient
      choice. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider this addition.
      <me>
        \frac{7}{24} + \frac{11}{36}
      </me>
      We could mutliply <m>24 \times 36 = 864</m> and use that as a
      common denominator; that would work. However, I'll multiply the
      first fraction by <m>3</m> and the second by <m>2</m>.
      <me>
        \frac{7 \times 3}{24 \times 3} + \frac{11 \times 2}{36 \times
        2} = \frac{21}{72} + \frac{22}{72} = \frac{43}{72} 
      </me>
      This produces a common denominator of <m>72</m>, which is much
      smaller and nicer to work with, compared with <m>864</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might have wondered how I came up with <m>72</m> as a common
      denominator. There are several answers. The intuitive answer is
      that I noticed that <m>24</m> amd <m>36</m> have common factors.
      More precisely, there are both multiples of <m>12</m>. So I
      wondered if there was another multiple of <m>12</m> which would
      work for a common denominator. By a little trial and error, I
      found that <m>72</m> was a multiple of <m>12</m> which I could
      use for a common demoninator. In practice, when I notice common
      factors in denominators, I'll often do this kind of trial and
      error to find a reasonable common denominator. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For those of you who like a more complete and formal answer,
      <m>72</m> is the <em>least common multiple</em> of <m>24</m>
      and <m>36</m>. I'm not going to review GCDs or LCM in these
      notes, but for those of you who remember that material, the LCM
      of the denominators is always the most efficient choice for a
      common denominator of fractions.

    <title>Multiplication of Fractions</title>
    <p>
      Addition and subtraction of fractions required common
      denominator, which is a fairly complicated multi-step procedure.
      Multiplication of fractions is quite a bit easier.
      The reason for this goes back to order of operations, as
      discussed in <xref ref="subsection-order-of-operations" />.
      Fraction are a way of writing division. Order of operation tells
      us that we can do multiplication and division in any order we
      wish without changing anything. Consider this multiplication.
      <me>
        \frac{4}{7} \times \frac{2}{5}
      </me>
      In terms of arithmetic operations, this is all multiplication
      and division. We can read this expression in the following way:
      take <m>4</m>, divid by <m>7</m>, multiply by <m>2</m>, and then
      divide by <m>5</m>. By order of operations we can do those in
      any order. If we do the multiplication first, we get <m>4 \times
      2 = 8</m>, after which we divide by <m>5</m> and then divide by
      <m>7</m>. If we divide by two number consecutively, we are
      dividing parts into parts. Dividing by <m>5</m> is making
      fifths. Then dividing by <m>7</m> is then dividing each fifth
      into sevents, resulting in <m>5 \times 7 = 35</m> total parts.
      All of this justifies the arithmetic:
      <me>
        \frac{4}{7} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4 \times 2}{7 \times 5}
        = \frac{8}{35} 
      </me>
      To multiply two fractions, we simply multiply numerators and
      multiply denominator. In more general terms and writing
      multiplication as simply adjacent variables:
      <me>
        \frac{a}{b} \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd} 
      </me>.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-fractions-division">
    <title>Division</title>
    <p>
      Division is likewise not as complicated as addition or
      subtraction with their common denominators. To get at the
      general rule, let's first consider the division of whole
      numbers. Say I wanted to think about <m>4 \div 5</m>. I could
      write this as a fraction <m>\frac{4}{5}</m>. Then, using the
      multiplication rules from the previous section, I could write
      this as the multiplication of fraction.
      <me>
        4 \div 5 = \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{1} \frac{1}{5} 
      </me>
      Using this, I can say that diving by <m>5</m> is the same thing
      as multiplying by <m>\frac{1}{5}</m>. This gives me a rule for
      fractions: to divide by a fraction is to multiply by its
      reciprocal. (A <em>reciprocal</em> of a fraction is the
      fraction with denominator and numerator interchanged.) 
    </p>
    <p>
      That gives me a rule which I can extend to any fractions. If I
      want to divide by a fraction, I can multiply by its reciprocal. 
      <me>
        \frac{4}{7} \div \frac{3}{5} = \frac{4}{7} \frac{5}{3} =
        \frac{20}{21} 
      </me>
      We can write this in general terms.
      <me>
        \frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a}{b} \frac{d}{c} =
        \frac{ad}{bc} 
      </me>
      I could also have writen this division as fractions themselves.
      Consider the numerical example first. 
      <me>
        \frac{\frac{4}{7}}{\frac{3}{5}} = \frac{4}{7} \frac{5}{3} =
        \frac{20}{21} 
      </me>
      This expression, with a fraction inside another fraction, is
      called a <em>nested fraction</em>. The rules for division
      can also be thought of as rules for dealing with nested
      fractions. Here is the rule in general form.
      <me>
        \frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{c}{d}} = \frac{a}{b} \frac{d}{c} =
        \frac{ad}{bc} 
      </me>
