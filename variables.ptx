    <p>
      When variables are first introduced, the are symbols that stand
      for some unknown or undetermined number. This is how they
      operate in equation. The most conventional variable is the
      letter <m>x</m>. The equation
      <me>
        4 + x = 13
      </me>
      is a question. It asks: what number, when added to 4, produced
      13? All equations with a single variable are implicitly
      questions: what value could the variable have to make the
      equation work? In this example, <m>x = 9</m> is the only
      possibility. Some equation have more than one possibility.
      The equation
      <me>
        p^2 - 7p + 10 = 0 
      </me>
      asks what values of the variable <m>p</m> produce zero when put
      into this expression. This equation has two answers: <m>p=2</m>
      and <m>p=5</m>, since <m>2^2 - 7(2) + 10 = 4 - 14 + 10 = 0</m>
      and also <m>5^2 - 7(5) + 10 = 25 - 35 + 10 = 0</m>. We could
      even have the silly equation 
      <me>
        h = h
      </me>.
      This equation asks which numbers are equal to themselves.
      Obviously, all numbers are, so the variable <m>h</m> could be
      any number whatsoever.

    <title>Solving Equation</title>
    <p>
      If we have an equation with a variable
      <me>
        5q - 6 = 25q + 9
      </me>
      and we want to know what value(s) of <m>q</m> satisfy the
      equation, we have to solve the equation. Solving here means
      making alterations to the equation to try to figure out what the
      variable might be, usually by isolating the variable. This leads
      us to a major, central idea in mathematics.
      <blockquote>
        WE CAN PERFORM ANY OPERATIONS TO AN EQUATION AS LONG AS WE
        PERFORM THE SAME OPERATION TO BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION!
      </blockquote>
      This is the principle we use to solve equation. Take the
      equation above. The first operation I'm going to do is add 6 to
      both sides of the equation.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          5q - 6 + 6 \amp = 25q + 9 + 6 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          5q \amp = 25q + 15  
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Then I'll divide both sides of the equation by 5.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \frac{5q}{5} \amp = \frac{25q + 15}{5}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      I can split up the fraction on the right (we are allowed to
      split up addition and subtraction in numerators of fractions;
      we'll talk more about manipulation of fraction in <xref
      ref="chapter-fractions1" />. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \frac{5q}{5} \amp = \frac{25q}{5} + \frac{15}{5}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          q \amp = 5q  + 3
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Then I'll subtract <m>5q</m> from both sides of the equation. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          q - 5q \amp = 5q  + 3 - 5q
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          -4q = 3
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Finally, I'll divide both sides of the equation by <m>-4</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \frac{-4q}{-4} = \frac{3}{-4}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          q = \frac{-3}{4}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      And I've solved the equation. The only value of the variable
      <m>q</m> that satisfies the original equation is
      <m>\frac{-3}{4}</m>. We could also write this as <m>q =
      -0.75</m> if we wished. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving can get quite complicated and there are many techniques.
      However, fundamentally the whole idea is that we preserve the
      equality of the situations by doing the same things to both
      sides of the equations; solving is the process of choosing the
      right operations to try to isolate the variable. (Sadly, there
      are many equations where no sequence of applying operations to both
      sides of the equation will produce a solution. The only such
      example that you'll need to be familiar with is quadratic
      equations, which are discussed in a future chapter.

      The solution to the original equation is <m>x =
      \frac{35}{14}</m>.

    <example>

          t \amp = \frac{-7}{32}

      This is the solution to the original equation.

        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          k \amp = \frac{2}{3}
        </mrow>
        This is the final solution. As a subtlety, since the variable
        <m>k</m> is in the denominator at the start, we know that
        <m>k \neq 0</m>, since that would lead to the nonsensical
        operation of division by zero. 
      </md>

    These examples cover solving equations using the four basic
    arithmetic operations. Many more examples for solving with other
    functions and operations are found in subsequent sections.

    <title>A Caution When Solving</title>
      <p>
        As we saw in <xref ref="example-variables1" />, there are some
        subtleties in solving. Many of these involve possible division
        by zero; we should always be aware of the possibility of
        division by zero by zero. This is particularly true when
        cancelling a variable. I can illustrate this with another
        example.
        <me>
          a(4a-6) = a(5a+1)
        </me>
        In this equation, if we wanted to try to solve for <m>a</m>,
        it would be reasonable to divide by <m>a</m> to make both
        sides of the equation a little more approachable. That cancels
        off the <m>a</m> on both sides. 
        <me>
          4a-6 = 5a+1
        </me>
        From here, we could solve as before. Omitting the steps, the
        result is <m>a = -7</m>. However, if we look at the original
        equation, <m>a = 0</m> is also a solution, since the equation
        then result in the true statement <m>0=0</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The point here is that whenever we divide by something on both
        sides of the equation, we have to be a bit aware of the
        possibility that the thing we wanted to divide by might have
        been zero. If it was zero, it can lead to extra solution which
        we might otherwise have missed.
