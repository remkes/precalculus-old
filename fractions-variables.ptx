    <p>
      One we start working with variables, functions and related
      mathematical expressions, all of these things can show up in
      fractions.
      <me>
        \frac{\sqrt{t^2+5} + t}{t^2 \cos t}
      </me>
      As we will see, the rules of fraction arithmetic remain the
      same, though some of the processes become more cumbersome and
      complicated with variable expressions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      With variables and mathematical expressions, we also have to
      worry about potential division by zero. In the fraction
      <me>
        \frac{6y-5}{y+3}
      </me>,
      all values of <m>y</m> except for <m>y = -3</m> are acceptable,
      but <m>y = -3</m> would lead to division by zero. It is very
      valuable to always keep in mind potential division by zero and
      take note of the values of variables that must be avoided. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For fractions with variables, we can still multiply numerator
      and denonminator by the same thing and preserve the fraction.
      <me>
        \frac{\sin z}{z} = \frac{(\sin z) (z^2)}{(z)(z^2)} = \frac{z^2
        \sin z}{z^3} 
      </me>
      However, this is only true is we haven't multiplied by zero. We
      need to keep in our mind that this expression doesn't work for
      <m>z = 0</m>. If we had multiplied numerator and denominator by
      <m>(z - 2)</m> instead, then we would have to keep in mind that
      are new expression is not valid for <m>z = 2</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      These new fractions don't necessary have any special
      terminology, except for one case. When the numerator and
      denominator are both polynomials (as discussed in <xref
      ref="chapter-polynomials1" />), the fraction is called a
      <emph>rational function</emph>. For example
      <me>
        \frac{k^2 + 3k - 4}{7k^3 - 4}
      </me>
      is a rational function (in the variable <m>k</m>) and 
      <me>
        \frac{a^7 + 4a^3 - 9a}{a^5 - 35}
      </me>
      is a rational function (in the variable (<m>a</m>). However, 
      <me>
        \frac{\sqrt{x^2+1}}{x-1}
      </me>
      is not a rational function, since the square root is not a
      polynomial. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the examples in this section, and most of the problems
      in the activity, will be using rational functions. If might be
      useful to do this section along side <xref
      ref="chapter-polynomials1" />. I'll use some of the techniques
      review in that chapter, such as the multiplication of binomial
      and the simplification of some polynomial expressions.

    <title>Fractions and Factoring</title>
    <p>
      For fraction with variables, we don't really talk about lowest
      terms anymore (that terminology is restricted to numbers, where
      there is a clearer idea of a simplest form). However, we can
      still factor terms out of the numerator and denominator of a
      fraction to simplify the expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first part, we can still factor numbers out the numerator
      and denmoninator. 
      <me>
        \frac{8x^2 + 4x}{2 + 10\sqrt{x}}
      </me>
      In this expression, we can factor <m>2</m> out of both numerator
      and denominator.
      <me>
        \frac{2(4x^2 + 2x)}{2(1 + 5\sqrt{x})} = \frac{4x^2 + 2x}{1 + 5
        \sqrt{x} 
      </me>
      Then we can divide numerator and denominator by <m>2</m>. We
      often don't explicitly show this division, but just cross off
      the <m>2</m> from each piece. We often refer to this as
      <qt>cancelling off</qt>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      More substantially, we can also factor our and cancel off
      expressions with variables.
      <me>
        \frac{t^2 + 8t}{5t^2 - 4t} 
      </me>
      In this rational function, we can factor out <m>t</m> from both
      numerator and denominator. 
      <me>
        \frac{t(t + 8)}{t(5t - 4)} 
      </me>
      Then we can cancel of this <m>t</m>. Implicitly, when we do this
      cancelation, we are dividing numerator and denominator by
      <m>t</m>. 
      <me>. 
        \frac{t(t + 8)}{t(5t - 4)} = \frac{t+8}{5t-4}
      </me>
      Here there is one caution and subtlety: the previous equality is
      only true if <m>t \neq 0</m>. Much like multiplying numerator
      and denominator by a term, when we cancel of a term, we need to
      make sure the term was non-zero. If <m>t=0</m>, the left side of
      the above equation is undefined due to division by zero, but the
      right side nicely evaluates to <m>(-2)</m>. That violates the
      equality. Therefore, we have to take note of the addition
      posibilities that may arise if the cancelled term was actually
      zero.

    <title>More Fraction Arithmetic</title>

    <p>
      <xref ref="section-arithmetic-of-fractions" /> reviewed the
      rules of fraction arithmetic. The examples in the section where
      all numbers. However, the rules of fraction arithmetic are the
      same for expressions involving variables as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multiplication of fraction is still multiplication of numerators
      and mulitplication of denominators.
      <me>
        \left(\frac{x^2}{x^2+1}\right) \left(\frac{2^x}{\cos x}
        \right) = \frac{(x^2)(2^x)}{(x^2+1)\cos x} 
      </me>
      Likewise, division of fractions is still multiplication by
      reciprocals. 
      <me>
        \frac{\frac{y^2+1}{y}}{\frac{y^3-6}{y}} = \left( \frac{y^2+1}{y}
        \right) \left( \frac{y}{y^3-6} \right) =
        \frac{(y^2+1)(y)}{(y)(y^3-6)}
      </me>
      There is a factor of <m>y</m> in numerator and denominator, so
      as long as <m>y \neq 0</m>, we can factor it out and cancel it
      off. 
      <me>
        \frac{(y)(y^2+1)}{(y)(y^3-6)} = \frac{y^2+1}{y^3-6}
      </me>
      This is the result of the division when <m>y \neq 0</m>. (When
      <m>y = 0</m>, the original expression was not defined due to
      division by zero, so this division holds for all possible
      <m>y</m> after all). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Addition and subtraction of fractions with variables still
      required common denominator. However, the common denominator is
      now (usually) an expression with variables. 
      <me>
        \frac{r + 1}{r^2} + \frac{r - 4}{r - 1} 
      </me>
      As with numbers, we can also take the common denominator to be
      the product of the two denominator. We multiply the numerator
      and denominator of the first fraction by <m>(r-1)</m>; likewise,
      we multiply the numerator and denominator of the second fraction
      by <m>r^2</m>. 
      <me>
        \frac{(r + 1)(r - 1)}{r^2(r - 1)} + \frac{(r - 4)(r^2)}{(r -
        1)(r^2)} 
      </me>
      That produces a common demoniator of <m>r^2(r-1)</m>. We can
      expand the multiplications in the numerator to see what we get. 
      <me>
        \frac{r^2 - 1}{r^2(r - 1)} + \frac{r^3 - 4r^2}{r^2(r - 1)} 
        = \frac{r^2 - 1 + r^3 - 4r^2}{r^2(r - 1)} = \frac{r^3 - 3r^2 -
        1}{r^2(r - 1)} 
      </me>
      Since we multiplied by both<m>r</m> and <m>(r - 1)</m>, this
      calcluation is only valid when <m>r \neq 0</m> and <m>r \neq
      1</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As with common denominator with numbers, sometimes there is an
      easier common denominator than simply the product of the two
      denominators. An example will illustrate this. 
      <me>
        \frac{6}{v^2(v+1)} - \frac{8}{v(v+1)(v+2)} 
      </me>
      The two fractions here have reasonable complicated denominators.
      I'd like to avoid multiplying by the whole denominator if I can.
      Looking at the two denominators, I see some common factors:
      <m>v</m> and <m>(v+1)</m>. The first denominator is missing the
      <m>(v+2)</m> in the second, so if I multiply by <m>(v+2)</m> I
      get <m>v^2(v+1)(v+2)</m>. The second denominator is missing the
      square of the variables, so if I multiply by <m>v</m>, I get
      <m>v^2(v+1)(v+2)</m>. In this way I can produce a common
      denominator without introducing as much complexity to the
      situation. Let's proceed with the subtraction, multiplying the
      numerator and denominator of the first fraction by <m>(v+2)</m>,
      and the second fraction by <m>v</m>. 
      <me>
        \frac{6(v+2)}{v^2(v+1)(v+2)} - \frac{8v}{v^2(v+1)(v+2)} 
      </me>
      This produces a common denominator, so I can combine the
      fractions and do the subtraction.
      <me>
        \frac{6(v+2) - 8v}{v^2(v+1)(v+2)} 
      </me>
      I can expand the <m>6(v+2)</m>.
      <me>
        \frac{6v + 12 - 8v}{v^2(v+1)(v+2)} = \frac{-2v +
        12}{v^2(v+1)(v+2}
      </me>
      I don't see any more simplification to do here, so this is the
      result of our subtraction. We are avoiding <m>v = 0</m>, <m>v =
      -1</m> and <m>v = -2</m> in this calculation to avoid division
      by zero.
