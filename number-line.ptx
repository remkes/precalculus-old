    <title>Numbers</title>
    <p>
      Most of the sections so far have been pretty practical: how to
      solve equations, inequalities; how to simplify fractions. This
      section takes a step back and is more conceptual. This is
      important. Mathematics is not just a series of calculation: it
      is an amazing framework of interconnected concepts. To be ready
      for university calculus is to be comfortable with the
      fundamental concepts and ideas of mathematics along with
      proficiency in calculation algorithms. In this spirit, this
      section starts with a very important question.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are numbers? This is an extremely old question,
      possibly the oldest question in mathematics. Our current answer
      to this question describes several types of numbers.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first numbers are the positive counting numbers: <m>1,
          2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots</m>. These are called the <term>natural
          numbers</term>. In theory, they continue forever, so even in
          this first type, we say that there are infinitely many
          natural numbers.  (The three dots notation, <m>\ldots</m>,
          is frequently used in mathematics.  It means that whatever
          pattern has been established will continue without end. Here
          is means that the counting number keep increases, adding one
          each time, without every stopping.) 
        </li>
        <li>
          In addition to the natural numbers, there is a special
          numbers that measures nothing. This is, of course, zero:
          <sq>0</sq>. Historically, this is
          actually the newest number on this entire list: the
          development and use of zero is a fascinating historical
          study. For some reason, the idea of making a special sign to
          indicate nothing was a phenomenal mental block in the
          development of mathematics. Usually, the term
          <sq>natural numbers</sq> starts at 1, so zero is not
          considered in the natural numbers. The term <term>whole
          numbers</term> is sometimes used to describe the counting
          numbers starting with zero. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Conventionally, the next set of numbers are the negative
          counting numbers: <m>-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, \ldots</m>. Again,
          these continue for ever. The positive and negative whole
          numbers, together, are called the <m>integers</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Now that I've given names to the whole numbers, the next
          step are numbers which are parts of a whole: fractions of
          integers. I've already talked about fraction a great deal in
          <xref ref="chapter-fractions1" />. They are numbers like
          <m>\frac{3}{4}</m>, <m>\frac{17}{23}</m> and
          <m>\frac{-110}{3457}</m>. Fractions can be positive or
          negative. Since they are forms out of any integers, there
          are, again, infinitely many of them. Collectively, the
          fractions are called the <m>rational numbers</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, there are numbers which cannot be represented as
          fractions. These are called <m>irrational numbers</m>. They
          include roots, like <m>\sqrt{7}</m> and
          <m>\sqrt[5]{11}</m>, and other special irrationals like
          <m>\pi</m>. The rest of this section will be spent
          understanding these numbers and how to work with them. 
        </li>
        <li>
          All of these numbers put together, including the
          irrationals, are called the <m>real numbers</m>. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <title>Visualizing the Numbers</title>
    <p> 
      The numbers are visualized by placing them in order. I'll
      start with the positive integers. By convention, numbers are
      show growing larger to the right, so I'll place the first few
      natural numbers after zero. This picture is shown in <xref
      ref="figure-number-line1" />. 
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="figure-number-line1">
      <caption>Positive Whole Numbers</caption>

          draw((-3,0)--(3,0));

    <p>
      If the positive numbers are written to the right, it makes
      sense to write the negative numbers going off to the left.
      This is shown in <xref ref="figure-number-line2" />.

      fit nicely between, as in <xref ref="figure-number-line3" />.

      This is now the familiar number line. The rational numbers are
      <term>dense</term> on this line. That meanse that they are
      infinitely close together and between any two rational number,
      you can always find another one. The reason for this is
      fraction arithemic. Between the numbers <m>\frac{3}{11}</m> and
      <m>\frac{4}{11}</m>, I can find another number by adding these two
      together and dividing by 2.
    </p>
    <me>
      \frac{\frac{3}{11} + \frac{4}{11}}{2} = \frac{\frac{7}{11}}{2}
      = \frac{7}{(11)(2)} = \frac{7}{22} 
    </me>
    <p>
      This produces the middle number, which I can see by taking
      everything to the denominator 22: <m>\frac{3}{11} = \frac{6}{22}
      \lt \frac{7}{22} \lt \frac{8}{22} = \frac{4}{11}</m>. I can do
      this in general: between any two fractions <m>a</m> and
      <m>b</m>, I can make the new fraction <m>\frac{a+b}{2}</m>. I
      can repeat and repeat. Anywhere in the number line, I can zoom
      in and find more and more rational, with out end. This is why
      they are called dense.

    <title>Gaps in the Number Line</title>
    <p>
      You might think, after observing the density of the rational
      numbers, that the number line is complete. You would have
      good company for this thought: ancient civilizations who
      developed fractions also thought, for many centuries, that the
      rational numbers were complete. However, you would be wrong. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the strangest and more important discovery in the history
      of mathematics was the discovery of irrational numbers. There
      are many of such numbers, but historically, two examples are
      most imporant. First, any square root which is not an natural
      number is irrational. The first of these is <m>\sqrt{2}</m>.
      Square roots, particularly <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, are geometrically
      very natural. Consider applying the pythagorus theorem to the
      diagonal of a square with side length 1, as in <xref
      ref="figure-diagonal-of-the-square"/>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="figure-diagonal-of-the-square">
      <caption>The Diagnoal of the Square</caption>
      <image xml:id="figure11" width="80%">
        <asymptote>
          size(8cm,8cm,IgnoreAspect);

          draw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2));

          label("$1$",(0,1),W);
          label("$1$",(1,0),S);
          
          draw((2,0)--(0,2));

          label("$\sqrt{2}$",(1,1),NE);
        </asymptote>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In my use of the pythagorean theorem, the two sides of the
      square are the short sides of my right triangle (<m>a</m> and
      <m>b</m>) and the diagonal of the square is the hypotenuese
      (<m>c</m>).  The theorem says that 
      <me>
        a^2 + b^2 = c^2 
      </me>
      I put the two side lengths into the formula.
      <me>
        1^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 1 = 2 = c^2 
      </me>
      I get <m>2 = c^2</m>, which is the same as <m>c = \sqrt{2}</m>.
      So the length of the diagonal of this square is <m>\sqrt{2}</m>.
      Hopefully, the simplicity of this geometric example shows you
      that square roots are a common experience in geometric problem.
      (Indeed, many other applications of the pythagorean theorm will
      lead to square root). In ancient mathematics, much effort was
      spent to find a fraction that equaled <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, but it
      was all in vain. <m>\sqrt{2}</m> has no fraction that matches it
      perfectly. It can be approximated by various fractions, but
      never completely captured. It is irrational 
    </p>
    <p>
      The second example is also geometric, one perhaps even more
      basic and fundamental than the diagonal of the square. The
      number <m>\pi</m> is the ratio of the circumference of a circle
      to its (twice radius?). If the (twice radius?) is <m>1</m>, then
      the length of the path around the whole circle will be the value
      <m>\pi</m>. In <xref ref="figure-definition-of-pi"/>, I've shown
      the (twice radius?) as a line before the cirlce, and below that,
      I've also shown a line that matched the path around the circle;
      this second line has length <m>\pi</m>.
    </p>

      <caption>The Number <m>\pi</m></caption>

          draw(-1,-2)--(5.28,-2));
          label("$\pi$",(2.14,-2),S);
        </asymptote>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Again, much effort was spend to try to represent <m>\pi</m> as a
      fraction, but again it was impossible. There is no fraction that
      entirely describes <m>\pi</m>. It is also irrational. 
    </p>
    <p>
      These numbesr, <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>\pi</m>, are reasonable
      lengths: they actually measure some geometric quantity. They
      should be part of the number line, since all points on the
      number line can be thought of a lengths from <m>0</m> to that
      point. The only reasonable conclusion is that the number line,
      using only the rationals, must have missing numbers. There are
      gaps in the number line. The irrationals fill those gaps. By
      adding all such numbers (of which there are, again, infinitely
      many), the number line is finally complete.

    <p>
      After these irrationals have been added, the numer line is
      complete. This set of numbers, including both rationals and
      irrationals, is called the <term>real numbers</term>. Typically,
      the real number are represented by decimal expansions, as I
      talked about in <xref ref="subsection-fraction-decimals" />.
      These reprentations are always approximate. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \sqrt{2} \doteq = 1.414213562373095 \ldots
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \sqrt{7} \doteq = 2.645751311064591 \ldots
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \pi \doteq = 3.141592653589793 \ldots
        </mrow>
      </md>
      These decimals expansions are non-repeating. The is no pattern
      to capture here; they are essentially random strings of digits.
      The real number is only completely understood by the whole
      infinite string of decimals, which, of course, cannot be written
      down. It's a strange business: having numbers represented by
      unwritable, infinite expression. But it is unavoidable. Other
      than choosing a symbol to represent the ideas (such as the
      symbols <sq><m>\sqrt{2}</m></sq> and <sq><m>\pi</m></sq>), any
      representation of an irrational number must always be infinite
      and therefore impossible to write down completely.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-the-continuum">
    <p>
      The number line is also sometimes called the
      <term>continuum</term>. A very important property of the number
      line, indicated by this term, is that it is continuous. It has
      not gaps. It forms a uninterupted line. Any line segment I draw
      should have the same property: I expect it to be a continuous
      object, with no holes or gaps. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It's only after adding the irrational numbers that the number
      line (the real numbers) are complete and have this desired
      continuity problem. This is immensely important, particularly
      for calculus. Without continuity, the main constructions of
      calculus are simply not going to work: they will end up falling
      in the gaps in the number, line, leading to undefined answered
      and unsolvable problems. It would be a mess. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It's worth pointing how strange this all is. A continuous,
      unbroken section of line is a very basic concept. It's the
      starting point for geometry, since I can't even draw shapes
      without drawing line segmets (straight or curved). It's a basic
      idea: an uniterrupted connection from one point to another. But
      inside this very basic idea lurk great and unavoidable problems.
      I try to capture the line using rational numbers, which seems
      complete since they are dense. But there are gaps. I fill the
      gaps with irrational numbers, but these are numbers I can't even
      properly write down, since they have infinite expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply put, there is a fundamental and intractable infinite
      built into something as simple as a line connecting two points.
      The continuum is vexing, and a great part of the history of
      mathematics has been coming to terms with the problems of the
      continuum and how it works. Calculus is ont of the tools that
      helps to deal with the continuous, since calculus start to deal
      with these strange infinities.
