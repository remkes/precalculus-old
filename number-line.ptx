    <title>Numbers</title>
    <p>
      Most of the sections so far have been pretty practical: how to
      solve equations, inequalities; how to simplify fractions. This
      section takes a step back and is more conceptual. This is
      important. Mathematics is not just a series of calculation: it
      is an amazing framework of interconnected concepts. To be ready
      for university calculus is to be comfortable with the
      fundamental concepts and ideas of mathematics along with
      proficiency in calculation algorithms. In this spirit, this
      section starts with a very important question.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are numbers? This is an extremely old question,
      possibly the oldest question in mathematics. Our current answer
      to this question describes several types of numbers.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first numbers are the positive counting numbers: <m>1,
          2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots</m>. These are called the <term>natural
          numbers</term>. In theory, they continue forever, so even in
          this first type, we say that there are infinitely many
          natural numbers.  (The three dots notation, <m>\ldots</m>,
          is frequently used in mathematics.  It means that whatever
          pattern has been established will continue without end. Here
          is means that the counting number keep increases, adding one
          each time, without every stopping.) 
        </li>
        <li>
          In addition to the natural numbers, there is a special
          numbers that measures nothing. This is, of course, zero:
          <sq>0</sq>. Historically, this is
          actually the newest number on this entire list: the
          development and use of zero is a fascinating historical
          study. For some reason, the idea of making a special sign to
          indicate nothing was a phenomenal mental block in the
          development of mathematics. Usually, the term
          <sq>natural numbers</sq> starts at 1, so zero is not
          considered in the natural numbers. The term <term>whole
          numbers</term> is sometimes used to describe the counting
          numbers starting with zero. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Conventionally, the next set of numbers are the negative
          counting numbers: <m>-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, \ldots</m>. Again,
          these continue for ever. The positive and negative whole
          numbers, together, are called the <m>integers</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Now that I've given names to the whole numbers, the next
          step are numbers which are parts of a whole: fractions of
          integers. I've already talked about fraction a great deal in
          <xref ref="chapter-fractions1" />. They are numbers like
          <m>\frac{3}{4}</m>, <m>\frac{17}{23}</m> and
          <m>\frac{-110}{3457}</m>. Fractions can be positive or
          negative. Since they are forms out of any integers, there
          are, again, infinitely many of them. Collectively, the
          fractions are called the <m>rational numbers</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, there are numbers which cannot be represented as
          fractions. These are called <m>irrational numbers</m>. They
          include roots, like <m>\sqrt{7}</m> and
          <m>\sqrt[5]{11}</m>, and other special irrationals like
          <m>\pi</m>. The rest of this section will be spent
          understanding these numbers and how to work with them. 
        </li>
        <li>
          All of these numbers put together, including the
          irrationals, are called the <m>real numbers</m>. 
        </li>
      </ul>

    <title>Visualizing the Numbers</title>
    <p> 
      The numbers are visualized by placing them in order. I'll
      start with the positive integers. By convention, numbers are
      show growing larger to the right, so I'll place the first few
      natural numbers after zero. This picture is shown in <xref
      ref="figure-number-line1" />. 
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="figure-number-line1">
      <caption>Positive Whole Numbers</caption>
      <image xml:id="figure08" width="80%">
        <asymptote>
          size(10cm,0,IgnoreAspect);

          draw((-3,0)--(3,0));

          dot("$0$",(0,0),N);
          dot("$1$",(1,0),N);
          dot("$2$",(2,0),N);
          dot("$3$",(3,0),N);
          dot("$-1$",(-1,0),N,invisible);
          dot("$-2$",(-2,0),N,invisible);
          dot("$-3$",(-3,0),N,invisible);
        </asymptote>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      If the positive numbers are written to the right, it makes
      sense to write the negative numbers going off to the left.
      This is shown in <xref ref="figure-number-line2" />. 
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="figure-number-line2">
      <caption>Positive Whole Numbers</caption>
      <image xml:id="figure09" width="80%">
        <asymptote>
          size(10cm,0,IgnoreAspect);

          draw((-3,0)--(3,0));

          dot("$0$",(0,0),N);
          dot("$1$",(1,0),N);
          dot("$2$",(2,0),N);
          dot("$3$",(3,0),N);
          dot("$-1$",(-1,0),N);
          dot("$-2$",(-2,0),N);
          dot("$-3$",(-3,0),N);
        </asymptote>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Now the whole numbers are arranged on a line. The fractions
      fit nicely between, as in <xref ref="figure-number-line3" />. 
    </p>

          draw((-3,0)--(3,0));

          dot("$0$",(0,0),N);

          dot("$-1$",(-1,0),N);
          dot("$-2$",(-2,0),N);
          dot("$-3$",(-3,0),N);

          dot("$\frac{1}{3}$",(0.333,0),S);
          dot("$\frac{-5}{2}$",(-2.5,0),S);
          dot("$\frac{13}{6}$",(2.17,0),S);
          dot("$\frac{101}{35}$",(2.89,0),S);
          dot("$\frac{-1}{7}$",(-0.14,0),S);
        </asymptote>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This is now the familiar number line. The rational numbers are
      <term>dense</term> on this line. That meanse that they are
      infinitely close together and between any two rational number,
      you can always find another one. The reason for this is
      fraction arithemic. Between the numbers <m>\frac{3}{11}</m> and
      <m>\frac{4}{11}</m>, I can find another number by adding these two
      together and dividing by 2.
    </p>
    <me>
      \frac{\frac{3}{11} + \frac{4}{11}}{2} = \frac{\frac{7}{11}}{2}
      = \frac{7}{(11)(2)} = \frac{7}{22} 
    </me>
    <p>
      This produces the middle number, which I can see by taking
      everything to the denominator 22: <m>\frac{3}{11} = \frac{6}{22}
      \lt \frac{7}{22} \lt \frac{8}{22} = \frac{4}{11}</m>. I can do
      this in general: between any two fractions <m>a</m> and
      <m>b</m>, I can make the new fraction <m>\frac{a+b}{2}</m>. I
      can repeat and repeat. Anywhere in the number line, I can zoom
      in and find more and more rational, with out end. This is why
      they are called dense.

    <title>Gaps in the Number Line</title>
    <p>
      You might think, after observing the density of the rational
      numbers, that the number line is complete. You would have
      good company for this thought: ancient civilizations who
      developed fractions also though, for many centuries, that the
      rational number were complete. However, you would be wrong.
