      Word problems have historically plagued K-12 mathematics
      students, and with good reason. Many of the conventional word
      problems mocked in jokes and memes deserved to be mocked, with
      their strange first-name setups and contrived situations.
      However, the idea behind them is fundamentally sound.
      Mathematics, and algebra in particular, is useful for describing
      all the parts of the world which can be reasonable described
      with numbers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me try to make the case with some <q>word problems</q> of my
      own. Hopefully, though, these are somehow less contrived that
      those historically found in many mathematics textbooks. In this
      section, I'm just going to state problems and talk about how to
      translate them into mathematical terms; I'm not also going to
      give solutions.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        These notes were written in the summer of 2020, in the midst of
        the CoVid-19 pandemic. The following type of problem was
        extremely relevant. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A certain small community has 143 active CoViD-19 cases. The
        number of active cases in this community is doubling every 23
        days. The hospital capacity for CoVid cases in this community
        is 47 beds. Assuming that 10% of cases require hospitalization,
        if the rate of transmission stays the same, how long until the
        hospital reaches capacity?
      </p>
      <p>
        Solving this question would involved translating the problem
        into algebra. If <m>t</m> is time measured in days, then
        doubling every 23 days is the same as multipling by 
        <me>
          2^{\frac{t}{23}}
        </me>.
        If we start at 143 cases and double from there, then the
        number of case after <m>t</m> days is 
        <me>
          (143) 2^{\frac{t}{23}}
        </me>.
        Finally, if we want to count hospitalization rate, we need 10%
        of this. To get that, we multiply by <m>\frac{1}{10}</m>.
        <me>
          \frac{143}{10} 2^{\frac{t}{23}}
        </me>.
        The problem, then, is what is the smallest value of <m>t</m>
        such that this expression is larger than 47: 
        <me>
          \frac{143}{10} 2^{\frac{t}{23}} > 47 
        </me>.
        Such a problem can be solved with logarithms, which are
        discussed in a future chapter.
        <!--
        Such a problem can be solved with logarithms, as in <xref
        ref="chapter-logarithms" />.

    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        (The numbers in this example are fabricated -- I haven't done
        the research to get the actual numbers). Say that 75% of
        employed Canadians commute by car and that the average commute is
        7km one way. If some program could convince 5% of these
        commuters to use other modes of transport (walk, bicycle,
        transit), how much less fuel would be used for commuting
        purposes?
      </p>
      <p>
        To translate this into mathematics, let <m>p</m> be the
        population of employed Canadians. <m>75</m>% of them commute
        by car, so we need to multiply by <m>\frac{75}{100}</m>. Doing
        this I get <m>\frac{3p}{4}</m> for the number of Canadian that
        commute by car. On averge, they drive <m>7</m>km one way, so
        <m>14</m>km in total.  Then <m>14\frac{3}{4}p =
        \frac{21}{2}p</m> is the number of daily kilometers these
        Canadian drive. There is some average fuel comsumption for
        these kilometer, which we can call <m>f</m>. Then the fuel
        used up by these commutes will be <m>\frac{21}{2}pf</m>.
        Finally, we want to know what a 5% sating would bring, so we
        calcluate 5% of this fuel usage. 5% is the same as
        <m>\frac{5}{100} = \frac{1}{20}</m>, so I'll divide by
        <m>20</m>. The total fuel saved would be <m>\frac{21}{40}
        pf</m> where <m>p</m> is the number of employed Canadian and
        <m>f</m> is an average amount of fuel used per kilometer. Note
        that this gives us the saving <em>per day</em>; if we wanted the
        savings per year, we would have to multiply by the average
        number of working days per year.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        In a very oversimplified model, let's assume that the cost of
        running a particular airline route consists of a fixed cost
        <m>F</m> (representing the plane, a share of the company
        infrastructure and other costs which don't depend on the
        number of flights) and a cost per trip <m>T</m> (representing
        the fuel costs, airport fees, staff costs for the pilots and
        crew, and other costs that are incurred per flight). The income
        from a flight (again, oversimplified) is given by the ticket
        price <m>P</m> per passanger. Over a period of 100 flights, if
        we know the numbers <m>F,T,P</m> how many passangers are
        required per flight for the flight to be profitable?
      </p>
      <p>
        We can translate this into an algebraic equation (or
        inequality). The costs are <m>F + 100T</m> and the revenue is
        <m>100Pn</m> where <m>n</m> is the number of passanger (on
        average) per trip. If we want the break even point, we would
        solve this equation
        <me>
          F + 100T = 100Pn 
        </me>.
        If we wanted the range where <m>n</m> leads to profitable
        flights, we would solve the inequality 
        <me>
          F + 100T \lt 100Pn
        </me>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      Hopefully, those were not contrived examples. Hopefully, they
      give a sense in which translating from quantitative real-world
      situation into mathematics is a reasonable and useful thing to
      do. Those these examples are simplified, the more complicated
      versions of these calculations are actually being done, in the
      world, by public health administrators, by environmental
      planners, or by airline executives.
